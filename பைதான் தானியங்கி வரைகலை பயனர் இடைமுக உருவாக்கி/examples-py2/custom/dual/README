This directory contains an exeample of a GUI with two different custom
widgets, ScrolledCheckedListBox and ScrolledFrame, which were written
externally from PAGE. The variants are "_d" and "_g" which give rise
to class names "Custom_d" and "Custom_g" in the GUI module and which
are renamed ScrolledFrame and ScrolledCheckedListBox in the support
module.

The ScrolledCheckedListBox was written by Greg Walters and is
borrowed from his ScrolledCheckedListBox example picked up and stuffed
into new "dual" toplevel widget along with a rehash of my lib_demo custom
widget. My original ScrolledFrame proved to have some problem with the
scroll bars, so I modified it along lines which I borrowed from the
ScrolledCheckedListBox widget. The toplevel also has a menubar
borrowed from lib_demo so the entries apply to the ScrolledFrame.

There is a Tsizegrip widget to facilitate resizing the GUI. The event
'<ButtonRelease-1>' is bound to the Tsizegrip so that when Button1 as
released  at the end of a resize, the Custom widget on the right is
refreshed.
