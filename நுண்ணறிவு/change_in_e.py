"""

Given the â‚¬ currency without cents, the possible change is composed of: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500

There is 4 ways to change 5 euros:

    5
    2 + 2 + 1
    2 + 1 + 1 + 1
    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

Write a function changes that returns how many set of change can be made for a given amount and a set of coins:



The correction bot will call your function like this:

>>> from solution import *
>>> 

For this one, I expect to get 271, in less than 100ms.

Yep, I'll try with other set of pieces and other amounts.
