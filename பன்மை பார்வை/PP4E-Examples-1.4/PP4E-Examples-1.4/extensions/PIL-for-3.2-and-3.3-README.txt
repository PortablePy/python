UPDATE OCTOBER 2013 (examples version 1.4)

PIL is now Pillow.  As of today, PIL's functionality
is provided in a fork named Pillow, available at:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/

Pillow is a drop-in replacement for PIL, with installers
for all Pythons in common use, incuding 3.3.  For example, 
on Windows 32- and 64-bit systems, respectively, fetch and
install the following for Python 3.3:

    Pillow-2.2.1.win32-py3.3.exe
    Pillow-2.2.1.win-amd64-py3.3.exe

All book image examples work with the Pillow install under 
Python 3.3 and 3.2, including PyPhoto, which uses tkinter 
image display, thumbnail generation, and resize operations.
I've also used Pillow for EXIF photo metadata tag processing.

Do not use the partial PIL version in this folder unless
you are runing Python 3.1 on Windows; fetch Pillow instead.

[Prior] UPDATE JULY, 2012 (examples version 1.3.1)

The PIL installer here is for Python 3.1 only.  At this 
writing (July, 2012) there is still no "official" PIL port
for 3.1,or the later and newer Python 3.2 or 3.3.

However, there are "unofficial" PIL ports for Python 3.X on 
the web which do work correctly, at least on Windows under 3.2 
and for the PIL subset used by the book's examples -- tkinter
image display, thumbnail generation, and resize operations.

Specifically, the installer named:
    PIL-1.1.7.win-amd64-py3.2.exe

at the site:
    http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 

runs fine for me in the book's PyPhoto program under Python 
3.2.3 on a 64-bit Windows 7 ultrabook laptop.  Presumably, the 
32 bit and Python 3.3 Windows installers as well as those for
other platforms at this site also work as expected. 

Thanks to both those who took time to port and post PIL, as well 
as readers who asked me about this issue.
