<H1>Python's New-Style Inheritance Algorithm</H1>

This article takes a brief look at the inheritance search mechanism in the Python
programming language.  Like some other aspects of Python today, this mechanism varies 
per line: inheritance has grown much more convoluted in 3.X, though 2.X users 
still have a choice in the matter.  To truly understand the current state of 
affairs, then, we need to begin our story in simpler times.
</P>



<H2>Classic Inheritance</H2>

<P>
Once upon a time (well, in 2.X's default and still widely-used 
<I>classic classes</I>), Python attribute inheritance&mdash;the 
<I>object.name</I> lookup at the heart of object-oriented 
code&mdash;was fairly simple.  It essentially boiled down to this: 

<P>
<I>Attribute name references search the instance, its class, 
and the class's superclasses depth-first and left-to-right, 
and use the first occurrence found along the way.  Attribute 
assignments normally store in the target object itself.</I>
</P>

<P>
And that's it.  The reference search may be kicked off from either an instance or a 
class, and there are special cases for <I>__getattr__</I> (run if the lookup failed
to find a name) and <I>__setattr__</I> (run for all attribute assignments),
but the procedure is by and large straightforward.
</P>



<H2>New-Style Inheritance</H2>

<P>
In <I>new-style classes</I>&mdash;an option in 2.X and mandated in 3.X&mdash;inheritance 
is richer but substantially more complex, potentially requiring knowledge of advanced 
topics to accurately resolve an attribute name's meaning, including descriptors, metaclasses, 
and the linearized class-tree paths known as MROs.  We won't delve into those prerequisite 
topics here, but the following is a cursory overview of the algorithm used, taken from the 
newly-released <A HREF="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do">Learning Python, 5th Edition</A>,
where you'll find new and more complete coverage.
</P>



<H3>To look up an attribute name:</H3>

<OL type=1>
<LI>From an <I>instance</I> I, search the instance, its class, and its superclasses, as follows:
   <OL type=a>
   <LI>Search the __dict__ of all classes on the __mro__ found at I’s __class__
   <LI>If a data descriptor was found in step <I>a</I>, call its __get__ and exit
   <LI>Else, return a value in the __dict__ of the instance I
   <LI>Else, call a nondata descriptor or return a value found in step <I>a</I>
   </OL>
<BR>
<LI>From a <I>class</I> C, search the class, its superclasses, and its metaclasses tree, as follows:
   <OL type=a>
   <LI>Search the __dict__ of all metaclasses on the __mro__ found at C’s __class__
   <LI>If a data descriptor was found in step <I>a</I>, call its __get__ and exit
   <LI>Else, call a descriptor or return a value in the __dict__ of a class on C’s own __mro__
   <LI>Else, call a nondata descriptor or return a value found in step <I>a</I>
   </OL>
<BR>
<LI>In both rule 1 and 2, <I>built-in</I> operations essentially use just step <I>a</I> sources 
for their implicit name look up (described further in the book)
</OL>

<P>
Name sources in this procedure are attempted in order, either as numbered or per their 
left-to-right order in "or" conjunctions.  On top of all this, method <I>__getattr__</I> 
may be run if defined when an attribute is not found; method <I>__getattribute__</I> 
may be run for every attribute fetch; and the implied <I>object</I> superclass provides 
some defaults at the top of every class and metaclass tree (that is, at the end of every MRO).
</P>



<H3>The assignment subset</H3>

<P>A subset of the lookup procedure is also run for attribute assignments:
<UL>
<LI>When applied to an <I>instance</I>, such assignments essentially follow steps <I>a</I> 
through <I>c</I> of rule 1, searching the instance’s class tree, though step <I>b</I> calls 
__set__ instead of __get__, and step <I>c</I> stops and stores in the instance instead 
of attempting a fetch.
<BR><BR>
<LI>When applied to a <I>class</I>, such assignments run the same procedure on the 
class’s metaclass tree: roughly the same as rule 2, but step <I>c</I> stops and stores 
in the class.
</UL>

<P>
The <I>__setattr__</I> method still catches all attribute assignments as before, though
it becomes less useful for this method to use the instance __dict__ to assign names, as 
some new-style extensions such as slots, properties, and descriptors implement attributes
at the class level&mdash;a sort of "virtual" instance data mechanism.  In fact, some 
instances might not have a __dict__ at all when slots are used, an optimization with 
significant potential to break introspection-based tools.
</P>



<H3>Precedence and context</H3>

<P>
The net effect of these procedures is to impose arguably subtle and obscure <I>precedence 
rules</I> on the foundational operation of name resolution.  For example, you can also think
of explicitly-referenced name look-up search as being ordered this way, as implied by the 
algorithm above (the corresponding steps of which are given in italics here):

<UL>
<LI>For <I>instances</I>, try:
  <OL><LI>class-tree data descriptors <I>(1b)</I>
      <LI>instance-object values <I>(1c)</I>
      <LI>class-tree nondata descriptors <I>(1d)</I> 
      <LI>class-tree values <I>(1d)</I>
  </OL>
<BR>
<LI>For <I>classes</I>, try:
  <OL><LI>metaclass-tree data descriptors <I>(2b)</I>
      <LI>class-tree descriptors <I>(2c)</I>
      <LI>class-tree values <I>(2c)</I>
      <LI>metaclass-tree nondata descriptors <I>(2d)</I>
      <LI>metaclass-tree values <I>(2d)</I>
  </OL>
</UL>

Some of this may be too subtle to fathom in full fidelity without a tour through Python's 
<I>object.c</I> and <I>typeobject.c</I> source files (which house the implementations of instances and 
classes, respectively).  Case in point: Python runs just one or two tree searches per name lookup,
despite the presence of four or five name sources.  And all this may happen in addition to 
selecting a context-specific starting point per the MRO, for code brave enough to use the 
new-style <I>super</I> built-in function&mdash;a tool with new coverage in the book, but 
omitted here for the sake of space (if not humanity).
</P>



<H2>Famous Last Words?</H2>

<P>
The new-style inheritance algorithm applies only to programs that use classes and OOP, of course, 
and grows more elaborate as your code or the libraries it uses adopt more advanced language tools. 
As usual in Python, some simpler scripts may still not need to care.  But there's little 
denying that new-style name lookup is radically more complex.  

<P>
To judge for yourself whether its added utility justifies its added complexity, see the 
aforementioned book for the full story on this topic.  And while you ponder such things, 
don't forget what Python's own "import this" motto seems to counsel in this department: 

<PRE>    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</PRE>
