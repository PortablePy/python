This is the top level of the examples distribution package 
for the book _Programming Python, 4th Edition_.

The "Examples" directory:
    contains all the book example code.  Its directory tree
    structure corresponds to the book's example label paths.

The "extensions" directory:
    contains 3rd-party open source extensions used by some book
    examples.  Its PIL package, or the newer Pillow for of it, must
    be installed for some image-based GUI examples (e.g., PyPhoto).

The "changes" directory:
    logs changes made to this package, gives outputs of code admin 
    scripts presented in Chapter 6, and includes snapshots of both 
    files in the book's suport website and O'Reilly's errata site.
