#
# module backwrd4.py
#
# backward chaining inference engine;
# 
# this is a variant of backward.py, which implements 
# backtracking by simply 'returning' to OR node 
# generators;  still uses Python call stack for
# both AND and OR node generators, by always 
# going deeper in recursion (never returning)
# while the current proof tree is succeeding;
#
# this is simply the 'generate and test' paradigm:
# OR() is the generator, and AND() is the tester 
# of all remaining goals;
#
# in retrospect, there's no reason to raise exceptions
# to return to an OR node (choice point) level;  we
# just return here;  the only disadvantage is that 
# we also return to non choice-point nodes where the
# user was queried (which immediately return to an
# earlier choice-point level);  we still keep the 
# stop_proof and negation exceptions, to end the proof
# when report() finds the user not wanting more solns,
# and for 'not' implementation;
