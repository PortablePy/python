#
# module backwrd3.py
#
# backward chaining with explicit stacks;
#
# maintains 2 stacks (represented as trees,
# (binary tuples), rather than lists):
#
# 'state' stack ('and' node generator):
#     (dict, goal-list, last-goal, rule-id, state)
# 'back'  stack ('or' node generator):
#     (state, var-changes, last-rule, last-then, back)
#
# INCOMPLETE:
# this variant works, but does not yet implement
# 'not' negations, or 'how' explanations;  these 
# are straightforward (but tedious) to add: for 
# 'not', insert a '_fail_' goal into the current
# state, detect it in the main loop, and force a
# backtrack to the 'back' that existed when the
# 'not' was started;  also push a backtrack node
# that backtracks to redo a 'true' goal (and so
# succeeds);  for 'how', we need to push the 
# current proof tree list on backtrack nodes,
# and restore them when backtracking;  we also
# need to detect end of conjuncts (in nextgoal),
# and add a '()' terminator to the how list;
# ex:
# state = ({}, goals+[['_fail_']], last, rule, state) 
# back = (({},[['true']],0,'not',state), [], 0, -1, back)
# left as an exercise for the reader...
#
# note:
# there's a slight overhead to pack/unpack tuples
# in the assignments; we might get a slight 
# improvement by using 5 seperate variables
# to represent current 'state'; for ex: when
# 'nextgoal()' just goes to the next 'if' goal
# and does no climbing, we could just add 1
# to the current goal index;  also: the 'rule' 
# part of 'state' tuples is only used for 
# ask_user, and could otherwise be ignored;
