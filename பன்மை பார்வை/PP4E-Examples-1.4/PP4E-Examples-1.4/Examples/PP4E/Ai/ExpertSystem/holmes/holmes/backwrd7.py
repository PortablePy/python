# module backwrd7.py
#
# non-backtracking version of backward.py
#
# this variant corrects the bug in backwrd2 (which
# copied variable binding stacks), by copying entire
# proof-tree-so-far, at each candidate in each choice
# point;  simply uses the 'how' linear proof trees
# already constructed for explanations, as the proof
# trees to compute (the linear form makes it easy
# to keep track of the current level's node);  
#
# this works, and avoids both backtracking and 
# generate-and-test coding (though constructing 
# candidate proof subtrees is really equivalent 
# backtracking early); see backwrd2 for more info;
#
# still suffers from these weaknesses:
# 1) very slow for large and/or proof trees;  again,
#    (x,y) cons-tree rep would speed up a little, 
#    but most time is spent copying proof dictionaries;
#
# 2) computes all solutions before any are displayed;
#    this is very inconvenient for interactive systems,
#    since all questions must be answered first;
#
# 3) 'not' negation is not exactly correct: it computes
#    _all_ possible solutions for the 'not' goal, and
#    then cecks if >= 1 solution was found;  'not' 
#    should really fail as soon as the _first_ solution
#    for the negated goal is found;  this might be 
#    implemented by adding a flag arg and extra logic
#    to OR and AND to return as soon as any 1 soln is
#    found (but we'd probably have to generate all
#    proofs for ifs[0..n-1] in order to detect the 
#    1st soln at ifs[n]);
