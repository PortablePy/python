# to do this, we concatenate the sub-proof tree for 
# each 'if' conjunct onto a list, for each fired rule;  
# since the conjuncts are matched to already known 
# facts, the new proof trees inherit their fact's 
# trees: ie, we construct each fact's proof tree 
# bottom-up, sing the trees associated with already
# deduced facts used to fire a rule;  this isn't too 
# expensive, since object ref's always share (not 
# copy) the ref'd object (sub-proof tree, dict, etc.)
