Sending this from PyMailCGI.  The mail goes from the web browser client, to 
the HTTP web server (running locally on the same machine), to the Python CGI
script, and finally to the SMTP email server at my ISP before being delivered.
When later fetched in PyMailCGI, it goes from ISP POP server, to CGI script, 
and back to the browser client.  The HTTP server and CGI script intermediate
steps are not present when using the PyMailGUI "desktop" client program.
