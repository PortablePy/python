# store items in a shelve, with file locks on writes;
# dbcommon assumes items are dictionaries (not here);
# chmod call assumes single file per shelve (e.g., gdbm);
# shelve allows simultaneous reads, but if any program
# is writing, no other reads or writes are allowed,
# so we obtain the lock before all load/store ops 
# need to chown to 0666, else only 'nobody' can write;
# this file doen't know about fcntl, but mutex doesn't
# know about cgi scripts--one of the 2 needs to add the
# path to FCNTL module for cgi script use only (here);
# we circumvent whatever locking mech the underlying
# dbm system may have, since we aquire alock on our own
# non-dbm file before attempting any dbm operation;
# allows multiple simultaneous readers, but writers 
# get exclusive access to the shelve; lock calls in  
# MutexCntl block and later resume callers if needed;
