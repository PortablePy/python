# store each item in a distinct flat file, pickled;
# dbcommon assumes records are dictionaries, but we don't here;
# chmod to 666 to allow admin access (else 'nobody' owns);
# subtlety: unique filenames prevent multiple writers for any
# given file, but it's still possible that a reader (browser)
# may try to read a file while it's being written, if the 
# glob.glob call returns the name of a created but still 
# incomplete file;  this is unlikely to happen (the file 
# would have to still be incomplete after the time from glob
# to unpickle has expired), but to avoid this risk, files are 
# created with a temp name, and only moved to the real name
# when they have been completely written and closed; 
# cgi scripts with persistent data are prone to parallel
# updates, since multiple cgi scripts may be running at once;
