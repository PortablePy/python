<H1>Common input devices: URL parameters</H1>

<P>This demo invokes the tutor5.py server-side script again,
but hardcodes input data to the end of the script's URL,
within a simple hyperlink (instead of packaging up a form's
inputs).  Click your browser's "show page source" button
to view the links associated with each list item below.

<P>This is really more about CGI than Python, but notice that
Python's cgi module handles both this form of input (which is
also produced by GET form actions), as well as POST-ed forms;
they look the same to the Python CGI script.  In other words,
cgi module users are independent of the method used to submit
data.

<P>Also notice that URLs with appended input values like this
can be generated as part of the page output by another CGI script,
to direct a next user click to the right place and context; together
with type 'hidden' input fields, they provide one way to
save state between clicks.
