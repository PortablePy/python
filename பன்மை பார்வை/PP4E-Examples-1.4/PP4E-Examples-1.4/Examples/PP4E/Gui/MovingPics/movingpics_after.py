"""
PyDraw-after: simple canvas paint program and object mover/animator
use widget.after scheduled events to implement object move loops, such
that more than one can be in motion at once without having to use threads;
this does moves in parallel, but seems to be slower than time.sleep version;
see also canvasDraw in Tour: builds and passes the incX/incY list at once:
here, would be allmoves = ([(incrX, 0)] * reptX) + ([(0, incrY)] * reptY)
