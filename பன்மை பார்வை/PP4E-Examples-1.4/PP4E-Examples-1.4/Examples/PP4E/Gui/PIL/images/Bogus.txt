Make sure non-images are simply skipped.

Note: 
These images were reduced in size to keep the examples
distribution small.  Fill this directory with images of
your own to see how PyPhoto handles larger pictures.

Image atachments in saved mail files were similarly
stripped; send some emails on your own to experiment.
