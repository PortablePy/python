PyPhoto requires the PIL open source Python imaging library 
to be installed separately, for image thumbnail generation, 
and for viewing of some photo types.  See the book for details,
and search the web to fetch and download PIL for Python 3.X.
A prerelease 3.X version of PIL is in the book examples tree.

Also note that images in this distribution and its saved mail
files were reduced in size and resolution to save space.  Use
images of your own to experiment further.


**UPDATE OCTOBER 2013 (examples version 1.4)**

PIL is now Pillow.  As of today, PIL's functionality
is provided in a fork named Pillow, available at:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/

Pillow is a drop-in replacement for PIL, with installers
for all Pythons in common use, incuding 3.3.  For example, 
on Windows 32- and 64-bit systems, respectively, fetch and
install the following for Python 3.3:

    Pillow-2.2.1.win32-py3.3.exe
    Pillow-2.2.1.win-amd64-py3.3.exe

All book image examples work with the Pillow install under 
Python 3.3 and 3.2, including PyPhoto, which uses tkinter 
image display, thumbnail generation, and resize operations.
I've also used Pillow for EXIF photo metadata tag processing.

Do not use the partial PIL version in this folder unless
you are runing Python 3.1 on Windows; fetch Pillow instead.
