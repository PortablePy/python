"""
See peoplegui--old.py: the alternative here uses nedted row frames with fixed
widdth labels with pack() to acheive the same aligned layout as grid(), but it
takes two extra lines of code as is (though adding window resize support makes
the two techniques roughly the same--see later in the book).
