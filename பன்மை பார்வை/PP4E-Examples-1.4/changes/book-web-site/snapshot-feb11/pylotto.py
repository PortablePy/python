=====================================================================
PyLotto: select students of a class at random to receive copies
of a book, working around various security constraints.  I use 
this to give away free copies of my Python books in some of the 
classes I teach.

In order to work around the security restrictions at some sites, 
this script tries to be general.  It can run the lottery in 3 
different modes, selected by command-line arguments in local 
console mode, or by URL query parameters in remote web mode:

1) to select from emails,
2) to select from names in a file created by web page submits,
3) to select from names typed into a local text file manually.

Accordingly, students enter the lottery in 1 of 3 specific ways,
depending on security at a given site; by:

(1) Sending an email message to "PP4E@learning-python.com" with 
    subject "PYLOTTO" and their From address.

(2) Submitting the form at "http://learning-python.com/pylotto.html"
    with their name, which adds them to a file on a remote web server
    (an equivalent GET-style URL described ahead does the same work).  

(3) Appearing in a manually-created text file of names on the script's
    own machine named "pylotto-players.txt" (physically, the script 
    and file may be local, or remote via SSH).

Winners are then picked at random from all players, by either scanning 
the email inbox and parsing emails, or reading the names file created
manually or by the web page submits.  Results can be displayed in 
console text or CGI web reply page format.  

In a bit more detail, the lottery script itself may be pysically run:

--in a local console to select from emails, if POP access is supported 
  at the site; 

--remotely on the web as a CGI script to select from emails or a file,
  if only HTTP web access is available; 

--in a local console to select from a local file if neither web 
  nor email are allowed.

These contexts translate to selection and display modes configured by 
command-line options:

 "pylotto.py -show console -find email" --runs locally  from emails
 "pylotto.py -show cgi -find email"     --runs remotely from emails
 "pylotto.py -show cgi -find file"      --runs remotely from a file
 "pylotto.py -show console -find file"  --runs locally  from a file
 "pylotto.py -form player"              --adds player name to file 

As described ahead, in remote CGI web mode, equivalent query parameters 
in GET-style URLs are simply translated to command-lines:

 "http://learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-show=console&-find=email"
 "http://learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-show=cgi&-find=file"
 "http://learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-form=player"

To enable CGI usage modes, set the script's "RunAsCGI" variable to True
when installing.  A variety of admin and test modes are also available; 
see this script's __main__ logic for more details.

See Chapter 13 for more on email tools, Chapter 15 for more on CGI
concepts, and Part 2 for hints on adding a tkinter GUI for sign-up
or reporting (I've already worked on this more than I intended to!).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: CGI and local file modes

Because the original email sign-up scheme requires email access 
which is not always available at client sites, I've completely
rewritten this script to also select from a flat file of names, 
which may be created by either web form submits or by manual edits.
This script can now be run locally or remotely, and as both a 
command-line script or a CGI script via a web URL.

In fact, it can now run locally on a local file as a last resort:
some pathologically secure sites may disallow instructor email 
access, but also student email sends, and even student web form 
submits.  In the worst case, names are typed into and selected 
from a simple text file.  Command-line arguments configure the 
script to select from either a file or emails, and to display 
its results in either console or CGI web reply format.

In CGI mode, this script can be run both to sign-up players, and
to run its lottery logic.  In both role, its URL may be run from 
a web page form's action, manually typed in a web browser, sent
with Python's urllib in a script, and so on.  For instance, to
run the lottery in CGI mode, a URL of the following form is 
submitted by the instructor (only! -- this would work if run 
by students, but the results it reports to them are not used):
 
 http://learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-show=cgi&-find=file

and submitting the "pylotto.html" form to sign up players is 
equivalent to sending a GET-style URL like the following: 

 http://learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-form=playername

These URL invocation forms also have command-line equivalents when
run in a local console (as discussed ahead, queries map to these,
which can also be run from a console window to test):

 pylotto.py -show cgi -find file
 pylotto.py -form playername

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: 2.X/3.X portability:

The original CGI option assumed your web server ran Python 3.X
and a separate 2.X version was coded.  I've also now updated this
single script to run under either 3.X, or 2.X for older installs 
(search for "OnPython3" to see the mods).  My ISP account is still
running Python 2.4 for default accounts (!).  Portability impacted
print operations, Unicode decoding of email text for 3.1 parsing, 
encoding to bytes for os.write, shiny new tools like sys.version_info
field names that aren't backward compatible, and some library module 
imports (e.g., 3.X's email.*, io.*).  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: use cgi.escape() for player names in CGI mode:

Crucially, the script also now runs player names through the
cgi.escape() call when in CGI display mode, else the "<..>" 
brackets in emails can throw its results diplay off: player
email address could be truncated in the reply page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: translating query parameters to command-lines in CGI mode

When run in CGI mode, the script now translates query parameters 
to command-line arguments, for compatibility with console usage 
mode.  For instance, the invocation URLs:

 http://www.learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-show=cgi&-find=file
 http://www.learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-show=console&-find=email
 http://www.learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-form=playername
 http://www.learning-python.com/cgi/pylotto.py?-reset=1

are translated into the following equivalent command-lines when 
they reach the web server and CGI script:

 pylotto.py -show cgi -find file         # pick from file, show HTML
 pylotto.py -show console -find email    # pick emails, show text [1]
 pylotto.py -form playername             # sign-up a player
 pylotto.py -reset 1                     # '1' is ignored here

Per the CGI spec, some web servers might pass through command-line 
arguments automatically when the query sting (after the "?") does 
not contain an "=" character (e.g, "pylotto.py?-reset"), but the 
server at my ISP does not: it simply adds all text after "?" to 
the query-string value.  Run calls to cgi.print_arguments() and 
cgi.print_environ() to see how your server fares; on mine, all 
text after '?' always appears in QUERY_STRING, not on sys.argv.
Could instead have two top-level __main__ scripts for console/web
with a common module, but that seems prone to redundancy problems.

[1] Footnote: as implied by these URLs, you can show results in either
cgi (HTML text) or console (plain text) form when running in remote
CGI mode with script variable RunAsCGI == True; this mode prints the 
required CGI header lines and performs query-string -> command-line
translation.  However, player names are CGI-escaped only in -show cgi
mode, not for -show console, so cgi is essentially required to display
email addresses when running in remote CGI mode to display in a web
browser (though -show console plain text makes more sense if you 
wish to grab the reply with urllib for display in a tkinter GUI...).
