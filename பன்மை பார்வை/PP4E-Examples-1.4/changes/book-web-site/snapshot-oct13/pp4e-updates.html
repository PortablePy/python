<P>
I've started collecting notes, updates, and errata related to the book
on this page.  This page may eventually grow to the have a more sophisticated
multipage structure like that of the Learning Python 4E updates pages, but I'm
adopting a simpler, informal policy here for now, partly because the book was 
just released, and partly because this book's more advanced audience will probably 
be more tolerant of the few inevitable typos along the way in a 1600-page book.
</P>

Below are the current and official lists of general notes 
and corrections for this edition of the book:

Only the last of these lists is true errata -- corrections,
intended to be patched in future reprints.  The first list
represents an informal book "blog" of sorts.  If you find an

<P>
I use this section to post general notes about the book,  
supplemental materials, and clarifications about book topics
and examples.  If any of these also deal with bugs or typos
to be patched in the book itself, their formal fix is listed 
in the <A HREF="#fixes">book corrections</A> section.  If this
list ever had a specific ordering, it has been long lost 
to the ravages of time and edits; today, its items are loosely 
grouped by topic only -- latest notes, bonus examples, Python 
changes, example program updates, and miscellaneous.

<H2><A NAME="py33emailfix">[Sep-15-13] A patch for running PyMailGUI under Python 3.3</A></H2>

<P>
Per the description
<A HREF="#py33emailbug">elsewhere on this page</A>, a Python 3.3 standard library change broke
some email address displays of non-ASCII names in 
<A HREF="#pymailguiall">PyMailGUI</A>, the largest example in the book.  
In short, the Python 3.3 email package's <B>formataddr</B> utility function now applies a new 
automatic MIME encoding for names, which it did not in the past&mdash;a curious and undocumented
incompatible change, which did not account for display-oriented use cases, and can break code that
worked well under Pythons 3.0 through 3.2 (including some in this book).  Luckily, this is fairly
easy to repair.

<P>
<B>To apply and use the patch</B> for this Python change, simply fetch the following two files, 
and copy them to the PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui folder in your book examples tree, 
per the more detailed instructions in the first of these:

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="py33patch.py">py33patch.py</A>&mdash;the patch to import, with self-test and docs
<LI><A HREF="SharedNames.py">SharedNames.py</A>&mdash;replacement for this file with required patch import
</OL>

The first file updates the email package to be backward compatible for the duration 
of the PyMailGUI program's run only.  The second file, an existing part of PyMailGUI, 
is simply augmented to import the first.  The first file also has additional 
documentation on the issue and its patch&mdash;see its comments for more details.

<H2><A NAME="webserverport">[Aug-22-13] Default port numbers in preview's webserver.py</A></H2>

<P>
Because it may be a FAQ, I've posted the important bits from a dialog 
with a reader who was having trouble running the web examples in the 
preview chapter of the book: see
<A HREF="pp4e-webserver-faq.txt">webserver.py pointers</A>.  
In short, on some machines you may need to change the hardcoded port number
used in this script to something other than "80", and list it in the URL
explicitly (and read ahead to the full coverage of this later in the book).

<H3>Update, Sep-15-13: patch for running on Python 3.3</H3>
<P>
There is a simple patch for an address display issue introduced by a change in 
Python 3.3's email package.  For details, 
see <A HREF="#py33emailbug">the bug</A>, as well as <A HREF="#py33emailfix">its fix</A>.
</P>


<H3>Update, Oct-19-11: new examples release 1.3</H3>
<P>
I've posted a new release of the book examples package, version 1.3, which has patches
for all 6 of the <I>PyMailGUI</I> updates listed in this section below.  The first two of these
were already patched in release 1.2, but the rest are new in 1.3.  Get the change log and the complete
new examples  zip file at <A HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596158118/">O'Reilly's site</A>, or 
fetch just the files changed within it in <A HREF="patched-files-13.zip">this zip file</A>.  See the book 
for details on running PyMailGUI in the examples package (via auto launchers, command lines, etc.). 
I don't distribute this program standalone, partly because it uses many other files in the 
book examples tree, and partly because the book is its documentation.

<P>
One admin note: Some of the changes made in version 1.3 of the examples package are too large 
to find their way into reprints of the book itself, but I recommend using the new version in 
general, and studying the files changed to see what was involved; it's a fair example of code
maintenance in action.  For changes too big to merge into the book, versions of the changed
source files which mirror the code in the book are retained in the examples package with 
a "BOOK-" name prefix.  For details, see the 
<A HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596158118/CHANGES.txt">change log</A> which is also
file changes\CHANGES.txt in the examples package.

<H3>PyMailGUI post-publication changes summary</H3>
<P>
After using the book's PyMailGUI email client for just over a year, I've collected 
a list of additional enhancements beyond those already described in the book (see 
the original enhancements list at the end of PyMailGUI's Chapter 14).  I am the 
entire testing department and user base for this program, so some issues have taken
longer to shake out than others.  The following is a list of all these additional 
PyMailGUI enhancements discovered and applied after the book was published, for 
completeness; their write-ups are located elsewhere on this page:

<P>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><th>1 <td>[Feb-01-11] <td>Using POP and SMPT timeout parameters (patched in 1.2, and book) <td><A HREF="#timeoutnote">write-up</A>
<tr><th>2 <td>[Jan-10-11] <td>Closing temporary output files for HTML-only emails (patched in 1.2, and book) <td><A HREF="#closenote">write-up</A>
<tr><th>3 <td>[Aug-08-11] <td>Decoding and encoding non-ASCII attachment filenames (patched in 1.3, and book) <td><A HREF="#filenames">write-up</A>

</table>

<P>
Interestingly, two of these changes, #1 and #3, are also inherited by the less functional <I>PyMailCGI</I> 
webmail example of Chapter 16, because they were applied in the common mailtools package.  There were a handful 
of additional changes made in the examples package and their book listings (e.g., a
<A HREF="#focuspatch">focus fix</A> in the <I>PyEdit</I> component used by PyMailGUI); see the 
<A HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596158118/CHANGES.txt">change log</A> as well as the changes' 
write-ups on this page for more details.


<H3><A name="pymailguishots">Screenshots</A></H3>
<P>
To sample the effect of changes #3 and #4 above, see the following PyMailGUI screenshots:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="pp4e-examples13-view.jpg">Mail view</A>: a mail both sent from and viewed in PyMailGUI, with non-ASCII attachment filenames
<LI><A HREF="pp4e-examples13-raw.jpg">Mail text</A>: raw text of this mail (doubleclicked), giving i18n filename encodings and date/time as sent 
<LI><A HREF="pp4e-examples13-list.jpg">Mail list</A>: the mail list window, showing converted date time for this mail relative to my timezone
<LI><A HREF="pp4e-examples13-view-many.jpg">Mail view</A>: another mail sent and viewed in PyMailGUI, adding non-ASCII content and other headers
<LI><A HREF="pp4e-examples13-raw-many.jpg">Mail text</A>: raw text of this mail, giving MIME encodings for content, headers, and attachment names 
</UL>

<P>
The support for non-ASCII attachment filenames and local-relative time in these is new in the 1.3 example
package, but the rest is original behavior.  See the book for more on PyMailGUI's i18n and Unicode 
support in other headers and mail content.

<H2><A NAME="py320inputbug">[Jan-4-12] Python 3.2.0 breaks scripts using input() on Windows [LP4E]</A></H2>

<P>
If a book example which uses the <B>input()</B> built-in seems to be failing,
and you are using Python 3.2.0 in a Windows console window, see 
<A HREF="http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/lp4e-updates-notes-recent.html#py320inputbug">this post</A>
on Learning Python 4E's update pages.  

<P>
This built-in was apparently broken temporarily in 3.2.0 (3.2) in Windows 
console mode, but has been fixed in later Python releases.  The quickest fix 
is to upgrade to 3.2.1 or later, or try a different environment; the book 
examples work fine in all other Pythons and most other contexts such as IDLE.
Scripts in both books may be impacted by this regression.

<H2><A NAME="py32structchange">[Jan-11-12] Python 3.2 removes struct.pack functionality for str [LP4E]</A></H2>

<P>
Another cross-post from the Learning Python update pages about a Python change
which impacts examples in Programming Python too &mdash; see 
<A HREF="lp4e-updates-notes-recent.html#py32structchange">this note</A> 
for details on Python 3.2's decision to drop support of <I>str</I> strings
for the "s" type code in <B>struct.pack</B>.  

<P>
This impacts a variety of examples in this book.  The simplest fix is to manually
encode <I>str</I> Unicode strings to <I>bytes</I> byte strings when passing to 
struct.pack, per the referenced note.  You can also run these examples in 3.1 
or earlier if that's an option, though newer Pythons are generally better Pythons.

<H3>An overview of Python 3.3</H3>

<P>
I've started testing the book's examples under Python 3.3, 
the latest release which features:

<UL>
<LI>A reduced <B>memory footprint</B> that is more in line with 2.X, 
thanks mainly to its new variable-length string storage scheme, 
and also to its attribute name-sharing system; 
<BR><BR>

<LI>A new <B>namespace package</B> model, where new-style packages 
may span multiple directories and require no __init__.py file;
<BR><BR>

<LI>
New syntax for delegating to subgenerators (<B>yield from ...</B>), 
suppressing exception context (<B>raise ... from None</B>), and 
accepting 2.X's Unicode literals to ease migration (3.3 now treats
2.X's Unicode literal <B>u'xxxx'</B> the same as its normal str 
<B>'xxxx'</B>, similar to the way 2.X treats 3.X's bytes literal
<B>b'xxxx'</B> the same as its normal str <B>'xxxx'</B>);
<BR><BR>

<LI>
Reworked OS and IO <B>exception hierarchies</B>, which provide more inclusive 
general superclasses, as well as new subclasses for common errors which 
can obviate the need to inspect exception object attributes;
<BR><BR>

<LI>
A browser-based interface to <B>PyDoc documentation</B>, replacing its former
standalone GUI client search interface ("pydoc -b");
<BR><BR>

<LI>
Changes to some longstanding <B>standard library</B> modules, including ftplib,
time, and email;
<BR><BR>

<LI>  
New utility in the Windows 3.3 installer which extends the system <B>PATH</B> 
setting to include 3.3's directory as an install-time option to simplify 
commandlines;
<BR><BR>
 
<LI>
A new <B>Windows launcher</B>, which attempts to interpret Unix-style "#!..."
lines for dispatching Python scripts on Windows, and allows both "#!" lines 
and new "py" commandlines to select between Python 2.X and 3.X explicitly on
both a per-file and per-command basis;

</UL>

<B>Plus more</B> changes I won't list or repeat here.  See my earlier 
<A HREF="http://rmi.net/~lutz/lp4e-updates-notes-recent.html#py33">3.3 preview</A>,
on the <I>Learning Python</I> update pages, as well as the official 
<A HREF="http://docs.python.org/py3k/whatsnew/3.3.html">3.3 What's New</A>
document at python.org for additional details on 3.3 changes.
</P>




<H3>More on the new Windows launcher: off page</H3>

<P>
Of these, the last 3.3 enhancement listed above will probably
have the broadest impact (in fact, it affects <I>every</I> Python 
3.3+ user on Windows), and merits a few more words.  Those 
words have grown too large for this page, however, so I've 
moved them to this separate article:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="py33-windows-launcher.html">The New Windows Launcher in Python 3.3</A>
</UL>

<P>
The very short story on the launcher is that it registers new
executables which are installed on your system path normally;
attempts to parse "#!" Unix-style lines at the top of scripts to 
determine which version of Python run; and supports commandline
arguments that give Python version numbers.  The net effect is 
to better support multiple Pythons coexisting on the same machine,
by allowing Python version numbers to be specified on both a 
per-file and per-commandline basis, and in both full and partial 
form.  It's quite a useful trick, though not without the pitfalls
described below.  For much more on the launcher in general,
see the link above, or the new appendix on the subject in 2013's
<A HREF="about-lp5e.html">Learning Python, 5th Edition</A>.




<H3>Python 3.3's impacts on book examples</H3>

<P>
The book's examples were initially developed on 3.1, but tested
successfully on 3.2 alpha before publication.  In general, most examples
tested so far appear to work well on 3.3 and as shown in the book.  As 
expected, though, the evolution in the 3.X line has impacted some behaviors.  
Among the most notable 3.3 changes that affect book examples:


<UL>
<LI>
<B><U>Standard library changes</U></B>:
The standard library has undergone a number of changes which may affect this
book's examples, including changes to the <B>ftplib</B> and <B>time</B> modules.
See my earlier <A HREF="http://rmi.net/~lutz/lp4e-updates-notes-recent.html#py33">3.3 preview</A>
for details.  The <B>email</B> package has also changed, but merits its own bullet here.
<BR><BR>


<LI>
<B><U><A NAME="py33emailbug">Email package changes</A></U></B>:
As anticipated and described by the book, changes in Python's email package
have broken some aspects of the book's email examples, including the 
larger <I>PyMailGui</I> program.  Most of PyMailGui works fine as is under 3.3, 
which is surprising given the scope of email changes.  But non-ASCII (I18N) 
email addresses in header lines which decoded properly in 3.0 through 3.2 
no longer decode under 3.3.  
<BR><BR>

For a graphical representation of this 3.3 regression, see this 
<A HREF="py33emailbug.jpg">screen shot</A> &mdash; the PyMailGui window on the
left is the book's I18N saved-mail file open under 3.3, and the window on the
right is the same open in 3.2.  The 3.3 version on the left fails to decode the
non-ASCII addresses which 3.2 handled, most likely reflecting an incompatible
API change.  More details on a fix, as well as additional 3.3 email issues, as 
they emerge.
<BR><BR>

<B><I>UPDATE, 9/2013</I></B>: A patch for this 3.3 incompatibility is now available,
as described <A HREF="#py33emailfix">elsewhere on this page</A>.
<BR><BR>


<LI>
<B><U>Windows launcher pitfalls</U></B>:
This is probably the most prominent change in 3.3, as it has the 
potential to impact <I>everyone</I> using Python on Windows, 
and not just the book's examples.  As for its general description, 
though, the generic coverage of its pitfalls here has been moved 
off-page to the last section of the launcher write-up.  For the
full story, see:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="py33-windows-launcher.html#pitfalls">The New Windows Launcher in Python 3.3</A>
</UL>

<BR> 
The short story in this department is that the new launcher:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Will now fail to run scripts having unrecognized "#!" Unix lines,
which causes a dozen book example files to fail in 3.3 (including 
the top-level <I>PyGadgets</I> and <I>PyDemos</I> demo launcher scripts).
<BR><BR>

<LI>
Will default to running Python 2.X for contexts that give no specific
Python version, which may cause many 3.X scripts to fail (including
files whose "#!" names just "python", as well as files with no "#!" 
line at all &mdash; the normal case on Windows).
</UL>

<BR>
With respect to book examples, the first point requires changing 
"#!/bin/env" to "#!/usr/bin/env" in a dozen examples files, and
the second point can be addressed by setting the launcher's default
to 3.X, via "set PY_PYTHON=3" (or the equivalent in Control Panel).
The Python 3.3 installer also has an optional PATH extension 
feature, which seems contradictory to the new launcher's goals,
but shouldn't cause scripts to fail in general.

<BR><BR>
As the off-page launcher write-up concludes, the new launcher is 
net Good Thing, but you need to be aware that it may break some 
formerly valid scripts with "#!" lines, and may choose a default 
version you don't expect which causes many scripts to fail initially.
</UL>

<I><B><U>Update, May 2012</U></B></I>: a quick web search says that there are unofficial PIL installers for

<A HREF="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/</A>,
though I have yet to test their operation with book examples.

<HR width=25%>

<P>
This book uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) extension for some image-based examples,
both to render thumbnail images, and to display additional image file types in tkinter GUIs.
Because PIL was not yet ported to 3.X, the book employed a custom installer provided by 
PIL's creator, and included this installer in its examples package as a temporary measure
pending an official 3.X port. 

<P>
A reader wrote recently to note that the PIL installer in the book's examples package 
works only under Python 3.1, and not for 3.2.  I don't track PIL's progress, but it has 
much more utility than the book leverages, and I suspect that this has held up the 3.X 
port (naturally, this is a non-issue for 2.X readers, for which PIL installers are 
available).  Since this is a general issue which other readers have asked about too, 
the relevant portion of my reply follows:

<PRE>
...

About a PIL installer for 3.2: an official 3.X PIL port has 
yet to materialize; it was considered imminent two years ago.
The stop-gap installer I was given by PIL's creator and shipped
in the book examples package is an executable for 3.1 only, 
which I unfortunately have no way to update.

I recommend contacting PIL's creator, Fredrik Lundh, about
this, and/or browsing the archives of and posting your query 
to PIL's email list to see what may be possible today.  

Fredrik's last known email address (two years ago):

    (please search pythonware.com)

and the image-sig email list for PIL lives here:
 
    <A HREF="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/image-sig">http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/image-sig</A>

If you get a resolution on this and can spare the time, I'd
appreciate a copy on what you find; other readers have run 
into the same issue.  If I'm able to uncover anything myself,
I'll follow-up. 

In the worst case, you can always install 3.1 alongside 3.2 
to experiment with PIL examples, or take the examples' code

I posted a note about pickling and bound methods on the clarifications page of the book
<I>Learning Python 4th Edition</I> which provides some additional background on how and why 
bound methods cannot be pickled.  

<P>
Since that note also pertains to the coverage of pickling in this book -- in

Chapter 17's in-depth database material -- I'm posting a cross reference to it

<H2><A NAME="printerrors">[Oct-28-11] More on printing non-ASCII filenames in 3.X: PYTHONIOENCODING</A></H2>

<P>
On Pages 279-282, the book discusses in substantial depth how
print calls can fail for some Unicode filenames in Python 3.X, 
and uses a try statement to catch such failures in the tree walker
script on page 276.  As described in the book, scripts should 
generally print filenames with care in 3.X if those names might 
ever be non-ASCII, by either catching print call exceptions or 
changing the <B>PYTHONIOENCODING</B> environment variable to allow for 
specific Unicode encodings in the standard streams.  For simplicity,
though, some of the scripts in the book do not take this advice: 
they simply print filenames blindly, and assume that you understand 
the issue given the general description starting at Page 279, and
will configure your environment if/as needed.
</P>


<H3>Filename print failures</H3>

<P>
As an illustrative example, I recently noticed a print failure 
in the <B>diffall.py</B> directory comparison script on pages 311-313 
after I added a few files with non-ASCII names to the examples 
tree (tests for PyMailGUI enhancements described elsewhere on 
this page).  As is and without environment configurations, the book's
version of the script dies with an exception on Windows when printing
non-ASCII filenames, even if the output is redirected to a file (which
sometimes avoids such errors):

<PRE>

Now, as suggested in the book's footnote on Page 282, this script works as 
is without errors if you simply change your PYTHONIOENCODING environment 
variable to UTF-8 Unicode encoding for the standard streams.  No code
changes are needed, and the script winds up printing Unicode text to the 
output file.  On Windows (where you also set this once and for all via
the System icon in your Control Panel):

<H3>Fix 2: catching encoding exceptions</H3>

<P>
Alternatively, it might be a bit more robust and convenient in some scenarios
to catch the exception in the script itself and print as raw bytes, instead of
printing Unicode text that must be encodable per the print setting.  A modified
version of this script that does this and works without environment setting
changes is available here: <A HREF="diffall-SAFE.py">diffall-SAFE.py</A>. 
Here are the parts added and modified in <B>diffall.py</B>:

<P>
This changed script still makes some assumptions (it must be able 
to encode the filename per the platform default, which is UTF-8 on 
Windows) and may need further honing on some platforms.  When run,
though, it avoids print failures explicitly; here's what it does 
with non-ASCII filenames in the printed output in the temp file:

<P>
This works, but it many cases it might be simpler and will require
much less code to set your PYTHONIOENCODING as needed, rather than 
trying to safeguard all your filename prints with try statements
on the off chance that they may someday fail.  Even in the diffall.py
case, other modules that this script uses could potentially fail on 
filename prints too, and may require additional error trapping code
unless we use the simpler and broader PYTHONIOENCODING scheme. 

<P>
I'm not going to mark this for changing in reprints or new example
releases, partly because this is a general issue which is already 
well documented in the book; partly because this is not the only 
book example that takes a loose approach to printing filenames; 
and mostly because such scripts will work without changes if you set 
your PYTHONIOENCODING as needed.  In other words, one can make a 
very strong case that this is more an operational issue than a program
bug, and so does not merit a code change.  As usual, if your scripts 
fail on filename prints in Python 3.X, fix as prescribed.

<H2><A name="examples">[Dec-28-10] Bonus example: web site maintenance, with HTML and URL parsing, FTP</A></H2>

<P>
As a sort of reward for stumbling onto this page, I've uploaded an extra example 
script here which would have appeared with the book's HTML parsing coverage 
in Chapter 19, had this book project enjoyed unlimited time and space.  
This script uses Python's HTML and URL parsing tools to try to isolate all 
the unused files in a web site's directory.  

<p>
I use this script for my training web site, as well as my book support site (the 
latter after fixing some HTML errors that rendered the script inaccurate when 
Python's strict HTML parser failed and caused some used files to be missed).  This
script also includes code to delete the unused files from a remote site by FTP if 
you wish to enable it (pending a resolution on the parser failures issue), and 
includes suggestions for parsing with patttern matching instead of the HTML parser.

<H3>Update Feb-22-11: New version: rewrite for more usage modes</H3>

<P>
In light of security constraints in a recent class, I've completely rewritten 
the <I>PyLotto</I> script for worst-case scenarios.  It can now select from both emails, 
and a names file created manually or via web form submits, and can be run in both
console and remote CGI modes.  In pathological cases, it can be run locally to
select from a local names file (and in fact had to in a recent class somewhere in
the wilds of California).  I've also updated to port the single script to work on 
both Python 3.X and 2.X, and to properly escape student names in the reply HTML.
Here's the new code -- use the "view source" option to view the form's HTML:

<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="pylotto.py">pylotto.py</A></B>, the main script, in a CGI directory in remote mode
<LI><A HREF="pylotto.html">pylotto.html</A>, the sign-up form web page, on the server
<LI><A HREF="pylotto-run.txt">pylotto-run.txt</A>, output from the script's -test option
</UL>

Read the script's docstring for all the details.  Among other things, it demonstrates 
how to implement simple state retention in CGI scripts, using flat files and locks for 
possible concurrent updates to the players file.  You can also view the 
sign-up instructions files:  
<A HREF="lotto-howto-email.txt">lotto-howto-email.txt</A> and
<A HREF="lotto-howto-web.txt">lotto-howto-web.txt</A>,  
as well as a last-resort script which became a class exercise and
gave rise to (and is subsumed by) this new generalized
Pylotto: <A HREF="simple-pylotto.py">simple-pylotto.py</A>.  

<p>
The rest of this section describes the original, now defunct version, but also gives
the back story.  The new version has the same goals, but supports web form and local file 
sign-up modes in addition to emails.
</P>



<H3>Original version and description</H3>
<P>
Here's another supplemental example that might have appeared in the book, 
if not for time and its conceptual dependencies.  I wrote this script, <I>PyLotto</I>, 
in order to give away free books in some of the classes I teach.  O'Reilly always
sends a batch of free copies to authors, and if I kept a dozen copies of every one
of the 12 Python books I've written, some of which are not exactly small, I'd 
probably need a bigger house.

<p>
To enter the book lottery, students send an email message to the book's account,
with "PYLOTTO" in the subject line.  At the end of the class, the script scans, 
parses, and deletes these emails, and selects a set of their "From" addresses 
at random as winners.  It's not Vegas, but it's fair, and serves as a nice example
of practical Python programming that ties together a number of tools presented in
the book.  This script also has a test mode that sends test emails, and an as-CGI 
mode for running on a Web server if the training site doesn't allow POP email access
or SSH (many don't).

<i>New:</I> See also <A HREF="pylotto-orig-24.py">pylotto-orig-24.py</A>, a version of 
pylotto.py modified to run remotely as a CGI script on a Python 2.4 web 
server (that's the latest Python available on godaddy.com, as of January 2011!).


<P>
Naturally, I don't give away books in every class I teach (this basically 
depends on how many freebies O'Reilly has given to me, and how willing I 
am to lug around a big, giant book in my checked luggage).  Even so, scripts 
such as this one and others in the book which address real, practical needs 
can go far to help illustrate Python applications in action once students or 
readers have mastered Python language fundamentals.  As stated in the book,
Python tends to become a sort of <i>enabling technology</i> for most people 
who've learned to use it well.

<H2><A name="flatten">[Feb-3-11] Bonus example: Extracting music files from an iTunes directory tree</A></H2>


<H3>Update Nov-5-11: New version: resolving disparate collections</H3>

<P>
I've written a new and very different version of this script to be used
to isolate differences in iTunes collections on different laptops or 
archives, rather than just flatten directories and detect protected files.  
Grab the new 2.X/3.X version here: <B><A HREF="flatten-itunes-2.py">flatten-itunes-2.py</A></B>.

<P>
I wrote this version to help resolve differences between iTunes collections 
on multiple machines that have fallen out of sycnc over time.  It's easy to 
get in this state if you buy songs on whatever laptop you have at the moment
and don't synchronize religiously (cloud storage addresses this in theory, 
though not without potential downsides of its own).  Because iTunes may 
accumulate different files and directory structures on different machines, 
it's nearly impossible to synchronize unless you normalize its files into 
a simpler, uniform structure.  

<P>
This new version addresses this by sorting all files in the iTunes directory 
tree into 4 flat directories (playable, protected, irrelevant, and other), 
for each collection it's run against.  This makes it simpler both to run later
comparisons to spot differences (e.g., using the book's 
<B><A HREF="dirdiff.py">dirdiff.py</A></B> or more in-depth
diffall.py scripts of Chapter 6), and to copy merged collections from device 
to device.  This version also retains all files in the tree; renames duplicates
with a numeric suffix; produces a richer
<A HREF="amazon-results.txt">report</A>; and was updated to run on both Python 
2.X and 3.X.  It's safe to run against an iTunes location just to experiment,
because it only copies files from there, and does not modify the iTunes tree 
itself in any way.

<P>
After collecting files into flat directories with this script, I later merged 
the playable files directories with manual drag-and-drop operations, and also 
ran a simpler script, <B><A HREF="renamer.py">renamer.py</A></B>, on the result
to strip the leading track/disk numbers at the front of some filenames, making 
it easier to compare and sort, and islolate more duplicates (e.g., "02 xxx.mp3" 
and "xxx.mp3").  The end result is a single, flat directory of song files to 
use on multiple devices.

<P>
Note: this is only an iTunes <I>utility</I>, for analysing your collections' 
content or moving your music files.  It's not a player or iTunes replacement,
and although its result directories retain all iTunes music files, they may not 
retain all iTunes information.  For example, due to the way the script flattens 
music directory trees, its result directories may lose some associations between 
music files and their album artwork images, at least for images not embedded in
music files themselves (e.g., via ID3v2 frames for MP3 files).  Writing a full 
replacement for iTunes in Python (<I>PyTunes?</I>) would be an interesting 
project, and others have already made progress along these lines -- check out:

Here's something similarly practical, but a bit simpler than the prior two sections' 
programs -- a Python script which walks all the folders and subfolders in an iTunes 
directory tree, to copy all music files in the tree to a flat directory.  I use 
this to create a single directory of all my music on a memory stick, so it can be 
used conveniently on the harddrive in a vehicle I drive.  iTunes seems fond of nested 
directories, and the vehicle in question doesn't do well in their presence.  This example
might have appeared in the larger systems examples chapter, if not for time, space, 
and the fact that it's not too much different from tree-walkers already in that chapter.

<H2><A name="notes32">[Dec-31-10] Python 3.2 updates</A></H2>

<P>
As described in its Preface, this book was written under Python 3.1, and its major
examples were retested and verified to work under Python 3.2 alpha just before 
publication.  Because of that, this book is technically based on both 3.1 and 3.2, 
though it addresses the entire 3.X line in general.

<P>
That said, you will find some discussion of 3.1 library issues in the book that 
have changed or improved in the upcoming 3.2 version, which is due to be released 
roughly two months after this book's release date (3.2 final is currently 
scheduled for mid February 2011).  Some of the issues in 3.1's <B>email</B> 
package which the book must workaround, for instance, have been improved or 
repaired in 3.2.  

<P>
In fact, many or most of the issues of the 3.1 email package described in Chapter
13 are fixed in 3.2.  The email workarounds coded in that chapter still work under
3.2 (and were verified and even enhanced to do so before publication), but some 
are no longer required with 3.2.  Notably, the email package in 3.2 now supports 
parsing the raw <i>bytes</i> returned by the SMTP module, thereby eliminating the 
need for the partially heuristic and potentially error prone pre-parse decoding 
to <i>str</i> that the book's 3.1-based examples must perform.  The next section 
explains how this works in 3.2.

<H3>Email and bytes in 3.2: the surrogates replacement trick</H3>

<P>
As a prominent example of email's improvements, 3.2's <I>What's New</I> document 
states that the 3.2 email package's "New functions <B>message_from_bytes()</B> and
<B>message_from_binary_file()</B>, and new classes <B>BytesFeedParser</B> and 
<B>BytesParser</B> allow binary message data to be parsed into model objects".  
Interestingly, the 3.2 email parser still does not parse bytes internally.  
Insted, these extensions work their magic by decoding raw binary bytes data to 
Unicode str text prior to parsing, using the ASCII encoding and passing 
"<B>surrogateescape</B>" for the decoding call's errors flag.

<P>
In short, the <B>surrogateescape</B> error replacement scheme translates undecodable bytes to 
Unicode codepoint escape sequences, which allow the bytes' original values to be recovered when 
the text is encoded back again to bytes by compatible software.  When parsed message parts are 
later fetched through the Message API, re-encoding back to binary form with the same errors 
replacement scheme is expected to restore the original data.  At least potentially, this 
arguably clever trick could resolve the initial decode-to-str issue for parsing email messages
in Chapter 13.

<P>
On the <B>downside</B>, because this scheme assumes that message data is both decoded to Unicode text 
and re-encoded to bytes later using the surrogateescape error handler for both steps, this 
trick works for data passed through Python's APIs which follow this translation protocol, but 
can fail for data which is not.  Moreover, this scheme also assumes that any data mangled by 
the surrogates replacement step is not significant to the parser's analysis, as it might not 
match expected characters in the stream -- a non-issue for binary data or encoded text parts,
but potentially significant for some forms of full-message raw text (though non-ASCII bytes
are unlikely to mean much to a message parser in any form). 

<P>
Also note that while this change may be a first step towards addressing the related 
<B>CGI uploads</B> issue described in Chapters 15 and 16, this issue still exists in Python 3.2. 
As described in the book, CGI uploads are somewhat broken in 3.X today because Python's CGI 
module uses the email parser, but its uploaded data can be arbitrary combinations of both binary 
data and text of a variety of Unicode encodings, with or without MIME encodings and content type 
headers.  Such data cannot be decoded to str in 3.1 as required by its email parser.  
Unfortunately, the CGI module in Python 3.2 still uses the <i>str</i>-based email parsing API, 
not the new <i>bytes</i>-based API, so this CGI uploads limitation appears to <I>still be present
in 3.2</I>.  I verified that this is the case in 3.2 final: cgi does not use the email's new bytes
parser interface, but still performs a pre-parse decoding from bytes to str per UTF-8, which may 
fail for some data streams.  A resolution to this appears to await a future Python.

<P>
For <B>email</B>, though, 3.2's library fixes represent a significant improvement over 3.1: the 
decode-to-str preparse issue for email, as well as other Chapter 13 email package workarounds,
may have been rendered superfluous in 3.2.  On the other hand, the book's 3.1 workarounds code is 
harmless under 3.2, and is representative of the sorts of dilemas faced by real-world development
in general --  a major theme of this book.  Unless you're lucky enough to use the same version
of software for all time, change is probably an inevitable part of your job description.

Not covered in that note is the <i>very</i> late 3.2 addition of its 
<B>concurrent.futures</B> library.  This library, based upon a Java package, provides 
yet another way to generalize the notion of multitasking with threads and processes, 
in addition to the existing <i>subprocess</i> and <i>multiprocessing</i> modules which
are covered in this book.  This new library is also a bit of a work in progress, 
intended for future expansion.  For more details, please see 3.2 release details and

As a cross-reference, be sure to see the Python 3.2 updates note <A HREF="#notes32">above</A> 
for changes in Python 3.2's email package which bear on the discussion in the section that 
starts on page 926.  Most notably, the preparse decode from raw <i>bytes</i> to Unicode <i>str</i>
needed in 3.1 is no longer required (but is harmless) in 3.2, because the email package can now 
parse bytes data directly, using the errors replacement scheme described at the note.  I'd mark 
this as an insert for future reprints, but the book can't possibly track all future Python

<H2><A name="timezones">[Oct-1-11] Sent time display in PyMailGUI list windows (patched in 1.3)</A></H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: I couldn't resist fixing this one after all: 
see the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above for more on 
version 1.3 of the examples package in which this fix appears. This fix 
was too large to add to the book itself.)</I>

<P> 
As is, message sent time is not displayed very usefully in PyMailGUI's list windows.
The GUI blindly displays the full, raw text of the Date header field.  Worse, the time 
portion of this header is truncated by the display such that the "+NNNN" field which 
denotes what the sent time really is relative to GMT is not shown.  The net effect is that 
you can't tell in the GUI when a message was sent or which messages were sent before others
without looking at the raw text and deciphering the Date time string manually.  The GUI 
lists emails in order received at the mail server only.  

<P>
To fix: the time in the Date field of list windows should be shown in full, and shown 
relative to either the local time zone or GMT uniformly for all emails received.  See 
the Python email package for pointers and possible tools; this doesn't seem crucial enough 
to detail the code fix here.  As a hint, though, formatting dates for use in new mails can
be either relative to GMT or the local time zone:

<PRE>
>>> from email.utils import formatdate      # in Python 3.2

>>> formatdate()
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:27:53 -0000'           # relative to gmt

>>> formatdate(localtime=True)
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:27:55 -0400'           # relative to local (us eastern, -4 hours) 

>>> formatdate(usegmt=True)
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:27:59 GMT'             # explict gmt relative for http
</PRE>

<P>
Applying the corresponding technique for adjusting a received date/time string 
to the local time zone in PyMailGUI's code is officially delegated to suggested 
exercise, but the following might help.  To convert a GMT-based date/time string
to a date/time string in the local US Eastern time zone, try this (it's 5:45 PM
GMT and 1:45 PM locally):

<PRE>
>>> from email.utils import formatdate
>>> from email._parseaddr import parsedate_tz, mktime_tz

>>> now = formatdate()                               # gmt-based => local (eastern)
>>> now                                         
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:45:26 -0000'
>>> parsedate_tz(now)                                # time string => time tuple
(2011, 9, 29, 17, 45, 26, 0, 1, -1, 0)
>>> mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(now))                     # time tuple => to utc timestamp
1317318326.0

>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(now)))         # utc timestamp => time string
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:45:26 -0000'
>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(now)), localtime=True)
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:45:26 -0400'
</PRE>

<P>
Using this scheme to convert from local to GMT, or local to local 
could proceed as follows:

<PRE>
>>> here = formatdate(localtime=True)                # eastern => gmt or local (eastern)
>>> here
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:45:47 -0400'
>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(here)))
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:45:47 -0000'
>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(here)), localtime=True)
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:45:47 -0400'
</PRE>

<P>
And finally, converting a date/time string from the US Pacific time zone
to either GMT or the local US Eastern time zone might be done this way
(it's now 10:46 AM Pacific, 5:46 PM GMT, and 1:46 Eastern/local):

<PRE>
>>> there = 'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:46:32 -0700'        # pacific => gmt or local (eastern)
>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(there)))
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:46:32 -0000'
>>> formatdate(mktime_tz(parsedate_tz(there)), localtime=True)
'Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:46:32 -0400'
</PRE>

<H2><A name="deletefix">[Sep-29-11] Delete and Save timing issue in PyMailGUI, rare bug (patched in 1.3)</A></H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: I wound up patching this in version 1.3 of the examples package;
see the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above.  There appeared to also
be a similar potential for timing issues for Saves due to their file selection dialog, 
which was also patched to check for blocking state before the dialog instead of after, 
though this seemed much less likely or harmful.  These fixes were too large to 
add to the book itself.)</I>

<P>
The short story: though unlikely, it's possible that deletes may delete the wrong 
message if you request a new delete while one is already running.  <I>Don't do this</I>, 
or read ahead to see how to fix this potential issue in code. 

<P>
Here's the longer story.  There is an obscure timing issue related to delete operations. 
As coded in the book, it's not impossible that a deletion thread's exit action may be 
allowed to run and clear the delete-in-progress flag, before a new delete request has a
chance to check this flag.  This can occur apparently because the new delete's 
confirmation dialog popup releases control to the GUI event stream, which can then run
a prior delete's exit action from an after() timer callback event.  Unfortunately, the
new delete issues the confirmation dialog <I>before</I> checking the delete-in-progress flag, 
and after fetching message numbers to be deleted from the GUI.  

<P>
The net result is that a new delete might overlap with one in progress, and incorrectly 
delete the wrong POP message numbers made invalid in the GUI by the prior delete -- a 
scenario the book and code both explicitly state must be avoided.  Note that the system
does go to great lengths to compare mail headers so as to ensure that each message being
deleted in the GUI matches the message being deleted on the server once deletions begin,
in case the server's inbox changes before a selected message is deleted (see method
<B>deleteMessagesSafely</B> in <B>mailFetcher.py</B>).  That doesn't help in this 
scenario, though, because the <I>GUI client's</I> mail list has been updated after selected 
message numbers were fetched, such that the prior selections no longer match the GUI or the
server.

<P>
This behavior is timing dependent, rare, and can occur only if you issue a new delete 
request while one is already in progress, and then only if you're unlucky enough to 
have the prior request's exit action run exactly after the time you press Delete for 
the new request and before you're able to click "OK" in the delete confirmation popup.  
However, this is also a classic and even illustrative timing bug; it reflects both the
lack of broader testing for a book's examples, and a misconception of the confirmation
dialog's modality -- the program assumed this dialog was truly <I>modal</I> (blocking), such 
that all the code from the start of a new delete callback handler through its 
delete-in-progress test ran atomically.  This must not be case, as I've seen a few 
incorrect mails deleted when running many deletes in parallel.

<P>
To avoid this potential entirely, <I>don't run overlapping delete requests</I>.  To fix the
code to avoid it in all cases, run the delete-in-progress test immediately in the 
delete callback handler, and before the confirmation dialog is issued.  Because the 
delete-in-progress test logic differs between the server and file list windows, this 
can be done by either moving the confirmation dialog call into each subclass's code, 
or adding a subclass-specific okay-to-delete method called from the superclass 
delete callback code.  For more details, see <B>onDeleteMail</B> in the 
<B>ListWindow</B> class on Page <B>1074</B>, as well as its two subclass's 
<B>doDelete</B> methods on Pages <B>1079</B> and <B>1083</B>.
I may patch this in the examples package eventually, and in a book reprint if 
possible; for now, consider it a maintenance exercise, as well as a lesson on both 
the need for rigorous testing and the complexity of code that may overlap in time.

<H2><A NAME="filenames">[Aug-8-11] Page 1123: More on encoded email attachment filenames in PyMailGUI (patched in 1.3)</A></H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: this was patched in release 1.3 of the examples package: 
see the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above (which includes 
screenshots of the fix), and the formal <A HREF="#filenamespatch">patch</A> 
description below.  This fix was small enough that it will appear in the book
itself in a future reprint.  

Note that because the fix was applied in common mailtool package code it is 
also inherited by the less functional PyMailCGI webmail example in Chapter 16, 
but you may need to set your browser's encoding to UTF-8 to view the non-ASCII
filenames embedded in the HTML reply stream.)</I>

<P>
After presenting the PyMailGUI client, Chapter 14 discusses a variety of 
suggested improvements to this system.  Among them, its Unicode enhancements
section on Page 1123 mentions that the filenames of attached parts might 
also be in i18N encoded form in some rare cases, and require the same MIME 
and Unicode decoding steps that are already applied to other primary email headers 
such as <I>Subject</I>, <I>From</I>, and <I>To</I>.  In PyMailGUI the latter of these 
are properly decoded for display and encoded for sends, but attachment filenames 
are currently not.

<P>
Encoded attachment filenames weren't present in the test cases used to 
develop this version of PyMailGUI, so they received only a brief mention
in the improvements list.  Moreover, some minor Unicode issues were 
intentionally given limited attention, partly because this book's size 
and time constraints limit its scope, but also because this edition 
uses the Python 3.1 <I>email</I> package which has well-known Unicode issues 
and limitations described in the text.

<P>
Lately, however, I've noticed that encoded filenames are becoming more common. 
This doesn't seem like a great feature of email in general -- Unicode filenames
that are encoded in a way not supported by the receiving platform's filesystem
won't work and would have to be renamed automatically (e.g., sending a Russian 
or Chinese filename may fail when saved on an ASCII-only filesystem).  Because 
of the increasing prevalence of such emails, though, I want to elaborate on 
ways to address them here.
</P>


<H3>GUI workaround</H3>

<P>
As is, the only GUI-based way to handle parts with encoded filenames in the 
client are to save the full enclosing email in a mail save file (list window: 
select, and Save); edit the mail's text in its save file to rename the 
attachment file name in its mail header line; and then reopen the mail from 
its save file (list window: Open save file, select in popup file list window, 
and View).  This works, but obviously isn't a very user-friendly procedure.
</P>


<H3>Coding fix</H3>

<P>
To do better, it might be simple to augment the <B>partName</B> method in 
Chapter 13's <B>MailParser</B> class to route the raw filename fetched from 
headers, to the <B>decodeHeader</B> header text decoding method already 
present in this class.  This would apply the required email, MIME, and Unicode 
decodings to such filenames, and yield a decoded Unicode filename string.  
Since the result might use a character set that doesn't work on the underlying 
platform's filesystem, though, this code would also need to try to encode it 
per the local platform's filesystem encoding type, and come up with a different 
name if the encode fails; it could follow the same naming pattern used for 
attachments that don't have a filename or name header present ("partNNN.xxx").  

<P>
For the adventurous, the <B>MailParser</B> class, used by PyMailGUI and other 
clients, appears on Page <B>976</B>; its <B>partName</B> method on Page <B>978</B>; 
and the required <B>decodeHeader</B> method on Page <B>980</B>.  The platform's 
filesystem encoding is described elsewhere in the book.  It's too late to add 
this enhancement in the book, of course, but changing this would make a nice 
exercise in code maintenance (or see the next section, unless you want to 
try this on your own!).
</P>


<H3>Update, Aug-15-11: partial fix details</H3>
<P>
To help you get started, it appears that the first part of the coding fix, 
decoding i18n filenames (but not also testing for their correctness on the 
receiving platform), is simply a matter of changing the very last line of the 
<B>partName</B> method in the <B>MailParser</B> class from the first of the 
following to the second:  

<PRE>
        return (filename, contype)

        return (self.decodeHeader(filename), contype) # aug 2011: decode fname
</PRE>

<P>
At least per minimal testing so far, this does the trick -- Chinese and Russian 
encoded attachment filenames are properly decoded, just like other encoded text 
in primary email headers.  These decoded filenames also happen to work unchanged 
on the Windows operating system (per UTF-8) in their decoded forms, though they may 
not work on some platforms, and their original i18n undecoded string forms always 
fail as filenames on Windows too and generate error popups in the GUI. 

<P>
For instance, a Russian email's jpeg image attachment whose i18n filename was given
in its part headers with a non-ASCII character set ("KOI8-R"), base64 translation 
("B"), and the encoded text ("8M/..."):

<PRE>
Content-Type: image/jpeg; name="=?KOI8-R?B?8M/Xz9LP1CBJTUdfMTQxMi5KUEc=?="
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="=?KOI8-R?B?8M/Xz9LP1CBJTUdfMTQxMi5KUA==?=
	=?KOI8-R?B?Rw==?="
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
</PRE>

with the patch is now correctly decoded to filename: <B>Поворот IMG_1412.JPG</B>.  
The original encoded filename text in the headers does not work as is.  Similarly, 
a Chinese spam email attachment's headers using UTF-8, base64 encoded values:

<PRE>
Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel;
	name="=?utf-8?B?6YeR54mM6ZSA5ZSuMuWkqeS4gOWknOWunuaImOiuree7gy54bHM=?="
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment;
	filename="=?utf-8?B?6YeR54mM6ZSA5ZSuMuWkqeS4gOWknOWunuaImOiuree7gy54bHM=?="
</PRE>

now decodes to filename <B>金牌销售2天一夜实战训练.xls</B> (which will look right in this 
web page if your browser understands UTF-8 text).  With this patch, these decoded 
filenames now appear correctly in the GUI's part buttons and its Parts list pop-up, 
and when saved to files and opened in other applications.  Non-encoded filenames 
pass though the decoder unchanged as expected, so this should not break any cases
that worked previously.

<P>
Because this is a simple change that doesn't alter line numbers, and because encoded
filenames are becoming more common, I may mark this as a future reprints update, but 
be sure to patch your code copy this way if it does not include the enhancement
and you start seeing encoded filenames in emails which you care to view.  


<H3>TBD: filesystem limitations, encoding for sends too?</H3>

<P>
Also keep in mind that the prior section's fix is partial: it still does not address 
filenames which won't work on the underlying platform's file system and may need to be 
renamed.  Perhaps just as glaring, the fix handles <i>decoding</i> for <i><B>display</B></i> 
of fetched emails only; there is no special logic for <i>encoding</i> non-ASCII attachment 
filenames per i18n standards for <i><B>sends</B></i> -- something which might have to be very
similarly addressed near the end of the <B>MailSender</B> class's <B>addAttachments</B> method 
by passing filenames through that class's <B>encodeHeader</B> method, which modifies non-ASCII
text only.  As is, on sends non-ASCII attachment filenames cause smtplib to raise ASCII encoding
exceptions for the full mail text in which the filename is embedded.  Given that such encoding 
is not supported by Python's <i>email</i> package automatically, the change may be as simple as 
this -- on Page <B>964</B>:

<PRE>
            basename = os.path.basename(filename)

            basename = self.encodeHeader(os.path.basename(filename))   # aug 2011
</PRE>

This should suffice: filenames that encode as ASCII are left intact and others 
are encoded per the UTF-8 default, though it would ideally also apply the <B>mailconfig</B>
module's <B>headersEncodeTo</B> setting if present.  But I'll leave this in the to-be-tested
column; I don't send such emails, and doing so seems a bit dubious in any event on the portability 
grounds mentioned above.  In other words, there is still plenty of room for 
improvement.  Enhance as desired.
</P>


<H3>The standard futurisms caveat</H3>

<P>
Ideally, Python's <I>email</I> package would decode filename header contents 
automatically and provide an alternative call for the rare cases when the raw 
text is required, and encode filenames for sends automatically in non-ASCII cases.  
Unfortunately, a future version of the <I>email</I> package may either decode
and encode filenames this way or not, so it's impossible to predict the optimal 
resolution to this in future Pythons (as stated in the book, this was a primary 
reason some email issues were not addressed as completely as they might have been).  
As usual for software dependent on external libraries, be sure to watch for changes 
on this front.

<H2><A NAME="smtp">[Jul-29-11] Email examples: using SMTP servers with logins and ports (patched in 1.3)</A></H2>

<I>(Update Oct-19-11: per the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above,
there is now a demo of the ideas here in release 1.3 of the examples package.
The changes were too large to add to the book itself.)</I>

<P>
As stated in the book, you may need to change your SMTP mail server
configurations to use the book's email clients to send email directly.
This is especially true when you try to send mail by SMTP on public
networks.  Some of this is ISP-specific, but here are a few pointers.

<P>
This recently resurfaced for me because my email sends stopped working
after my broadband provider changed their network.  In short,
they locked down the standard SMTP send port 25 in order to prevent spam,
but this prevented direct sends using the server configurations I had been 
using.  In the <B>mailconfig.py</B> file used by the PyMailGUI example,
my SMTP server configurations were originally the following -- a simple 
non-authenticating server at one of my third-party ISPs (godaddy), which 
worked fine on my home network and some others:

<PRE>
smtpuser       = None                        # per your ISP, None = no login
smtppasswdfile = ''                          # if login, set to '' to be asked
smtpservername = 'smtpout.secureserver.net'  # if port 25 open for SMTP on network
</PRE>

This no longer worked after the SMTP port lockdown.  To send emails, I
had to change my SMTP server details to use an authenticating SMTP server
at another third-party ISP, running on a non-standard port number (this
server runs on earthlink, which is different from my broadband provider):

<PRE>
smtpuser       = 'lutz@rmi.net'                         # login, authenticate
smtppasswdfile = ''                                     # ask for password in GUI
smtpservername = 'smtpauth.hosting.earthlink.net:587'   # 3rd party ISP, port 587
</PRE>

When so configured, I have to login to my email account at this ISP on the 
first email send in a session (PyMailGUI pops up a prompt for password
input), but Python's smtplib module automatically parses off and converses
over the custom SMTP port number included at the end of the server name string. 
This all just works in both PyMailGUI and smtplib, with no code changes required.

<P>
With these authenticated SMTP settings, email sends seem to work on many 
more networks than before, and I avoid having to resort to webmail with 
all its annoying advertising.  As an alternative, I could have routed email 
sends through the broadband provider's SMTP server directly, but this scheme
can sometimes be tagged as spam, and may require a direct connection to the 
provider's network which may not always be possible:

<PRE>
smtpuser       = None                     # per your ISP
smtppasswdfile = ''                       # set to '' to be asked
smtpservername = 'mail.mailmt.com'        # your isp or local network's server
</PRE>

See your ISP for more on your server settings, and the comments in 
mailconfig.py and the book for more on client configuration setings.

<P>
<I>Postscript</I>: I recently had to change servers yet again to use a broadband
provider account when Earthlink's SMTP server started timing out -- the 
following works in all contexts now for me, but your mileage will certainly 
vary (and possibly, very often!):

<PRE>
smtpuser       = 'myloginname'            # nonblank=authenticated
smtppasswdfile = ''                       # ''=ask in GUI once
smtpservername = 'smtp.comcast.net:587'

<H2><A name="closenote">[Jan-10-11] Close of a temporary file seems too implicit in PyMailGUI (patched in 1.2)</A></H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: per the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above,
this was patched in release 1.2 of the examples package, as well as in reprints of
the book itself.  See the formal <A HREF="closepatch">patch</A> description ahead.)</I>

<P>
I recently spotted something unusual in Chapter 14's PyMaillGUI, in module
<B>ListWindows.py</B>, method <B>PyMailCommon.contViewFmt</B> (after about a year, 
you get to be your own code reviewer!).  This method's latter part opens an HTML-only 
email in a web browser after displaying its extracted plain text in a PyEdit frame, 
and has worked well for my email ever since it was coded.  To be robust and explicit, 
though, it should probably run a <B>tmp.close()</B> after its <B>tmp.write(asbytes)</B>, 
to ensure that the output file's buffers are flushed to disk before the browser opens it.  

<P>
This isn't a bug and the code works as is, but apparently only because of fortunate
timing: the browser started by the <B>webbrowser</B> module doesn't get around to 
opening the temporary file until well after this method exits, which deletes its local 
variables, thereby reclaiming the temporary file object and automatically closing and
hence flushing it in the process.  This works, but seems too implicit in retrospect, and 
may not be the best coding pattern to emulate in any event.  In general, you should run
an output file's <B>close</B> or <B>flush</B> methods (or use the <B>with</B> statement 
or unbuffered open modes) to flush output buffers to disk if you expect to be able to 
read the file in the same program.  

<P>
See Chapter 4 for much more on output file closes (including rules of thumb which
I failed to heed in this context), especially pages 137-141 and 145.  The prior
edition strung the open and write calls together: <B>open(tempname, 'w').write(content)</B>, 
which, though still somewhat implicit, made the automatic close of the temporary file 
on collection more apparent and immediate, and not as dependent on timing.

When and where this problem occurs, an HTML-only email may open as a blank web 
page, because its temporary file has not been flushed to disk.  Oddly, on the 
faster machine, the web browser somehow opens and reads the temporary file before
the GUI method has a chance to close it on exit.  Moreover, this only happens for
very small emails (< 10K), suggesting a buffer size role.  Adding an explicit 
close() ensures proper behavior for all platforms and emails.

<P>
This issue is platform- and timing-specific; impacts just one minor aspect of a 
very large program; and, even when it does, can always be worked around in the 
user interface in three different ways -- by pressing the web brower's 
refresh/reload, by viewing the extracted plain-text in the GUI's main window, 
and by clicking the sole HTML's part button in the main GUI window to open it 
on demand.  Still, it's annoying and simple enough to merit a patch.

<P>
For detail-minded readers, the faster machine with the incorrect behavior was a 
multicore Windows Vista machine; the book test machine where the code works as is
was a single core Atom Windows 7 machine (a beefy netbook).  Since the Python 
method in question returns immediately after this code, on Vista a web browser 
apparently starts and opens a local web page faster than a Python method function
can exit.  This may reflect differences in the implementations of start commands
in the two systems.  I'd be surprised if this occurred on other platforms which 
spawn processes to open browsers; on the other hand, unpredictable timing has a
way of being unpredictable.

<P>
As described in the book, there are other issues related handling of HTML-only
emails which I've left up to an interested reader to address.  As is, display of
such emails employs a somewhat temporary scheme in lieu of an HTML-enabled text
viewer, which was tested and used by just a single user on a single platform.  
For example, its single temporary file model means only the last such email 
viewed is ever stored at any one point in time, regardless of how many are
opened.  Such oddness does not occur for HTML parts opened on demand, because 
their files are resaved and closed correctly in mailtools each time an open 
is requested.  As for much of this system, impove as desired.

<H2><A name="timeoutnote">[Feb-1-11] Using timeouts for poplib and smtplib connections (patched in 1.2)</A></H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: per the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above,
this was patched in release 1.2 of the examples package, as well as in reprints of
the book itself.  See the formal <A HREF="timeoutpatch">patch</A> description ahead.)</I>

<P>
The email-based code in Chapters 13 (and its clients in Chapters 14 and 16)
should probably pass timeout arguments to the poplib and smtplib connection 
calls, to avoid waiting indefinitely.  I've recently seen the book's PyMailGUI 
desktop client get stuck waiting for a poplib connection call that never 
returns, for example.  This is rare, but without a timeout argument, your only
recourse is to wait seemingly forever, or kill and restart the GUI.  See Python's
library manuals for more about passing timeout arguments in these modules.


</P>
<H3><I><U>Update, Feb-22-11: add timeouts patch for next reprint</U></I></H3> 
<P>
I've added the timeout arguments as patches to be made in the next
reprint and examples package version (1.2): see the <A HREF="#timeoutpatch">patch below</A>.  
This became a priority when I started seeing the email server at my ISP suddenly 
failing to respond to connect requests on a very regular basis; probably a 
temporary problem at the ISP, but killing and restarting the email
client's process manually was much more painful than patching to use timeouts for 
server connections.


</P>
<H3><I><U>Update, Mar-17-11: more on email server connection timeout arguments</U></I></H3> 

<P>
<B><I>Please Note</I></B>:
If you wish to use PyMailGUI for real email work, you may 
need to increase its email transfer timeout values to accommodate 
slower Internet access speeds.  As patched and shipped in the 1.2
examples package, both POP and SMTP timeouts are set to 20
seconds, which suffices in most cases.  Especially for <I>sending</I> 
large emails over slow connections or slow servers, though, a 
higher SMTP timeout value such as 60 or more seconds may be required.
See the <A HREF="#timeoutpatch">patch ahead</A> for the location of 
this value in the example code.

<P>
<I><B>Discussion</B></I>: 
This is a surprisingly subtle issue, not covered in the book.  POP and 
SMTP timeout values were added after the book's publication to avoid 
transfer threads hanging indefinitely -- a scenario which may require 
manually killing the email client's process in worst cases.  For instance,
failure to contact the server on mail Load requests can render the GUI 
largely inoperative (loads preclude most other operations, including Quit).
This is despite the fact that the load is run in a thread; the GUI itself 
remains active, but cannot perform most server-based email processing 
in this state.  

<P>
Passing timeouts when connected to email servers avoids this by triggering 
exceptions when server transactions hang, thereby terminating the server
transfer thread and producing an error pop-up in the GUI.  However, Python's 
library currently applies these timeouts to <I><B>every</B></I> server 
interaction step performed on the socket created for an email transfer: not 
just the initial connection calls, but also later data sends and receives.  
This makes the timeout setting sensitive to the speeds of email servers, the
speed of your own Internet connection on the client, and message size in general.
This is true for both fetches and sends (POP and SMTP), though it is more 
crucial for <I>sends</I>, which transfer a message's text all at once, 
than for <I>fetches</I>, which read messages line by line.  

<P>
Unfortunately, this seems a bit of a <I><B>Catch-22</B></I> -- larger 
timeout values allow larger mails to be transferred on slow connections, 
but also mean that email transfer threads will be hung longer when servers 
are truly inactive.  Moreover, the timeouts can't generally be omitted 
altogether, or the transfer threads may hang interminably -- as mentioned, 
in worst cases this may block other user operations in the GUI, and require
the email client's process to be killed manually when email servers become 
unresponsive (this was the original motivation for the timeout patch).
Really, Python's email library modules should probably support different
timeout settings for different operations; one for all doesn't quite
make sense -- sending a large email requires very different timeout 
treatment than initial connection -- but that's the API that exists today.

<P>
Although it's possible to implement more <i><b>custom</b></i> transfer timeouts manually
instead of relying on the existing library module support (e.g., add top-level 
timer code around initial connect calls only), this would require too many 
post-publication code changes, and would not suffice if later operations hang.
In principle, it's also possible to selectively enable and disable timeouts for
the socket embedded in and used by the smtplib's object (e.g., disabling them 
with server.sock.settimeout(None) for sends), but this is less than ideal from
a software perspective, as it makes smtplib module clients too dependent on the
module's internals: the module's API is intended to <i>encapsulate</i> and hide the 
underlying socket object used.  This would also fail to address servers which
become unresponsive during sends.

<P>
For sends, timeouts also trigger what looks like a <I><B>bug</B></I> 
in Python 3.1's standard library -- the mail send appears to fail after
the mail's text has been fully sent and while tring to read the server's
truncated reply to it, but only because the socket sendall() call 4 levels 
down from the book's code seems to simply stop sending data and truncate 
it when the timeout expires, without correctly raising an exception to 
signal this error (on a Windows Vista client, talking to my ISP's server, 
at least).  This leads later to a confusing SMTPServerDisconnected
exception with the error text "Connection unexpectedly closed" reported in
the GUI and the console, even though the true cause was the earlier data 
send's timeout.  (This is complex: I don't have time to explore it fully, 
or space to explain it here; for the full story, you'll have to trace 
through Python's source-code that raises this error, including its socket
module's C code).  Increasing the timeout allows sendall() to finish sending
the data without truncation, and is required in some contexts in any event, 
but it is also effectively a workaround for this erroneous behavior in 
Python itself.

<P>
<I><B>Summary:</B></I>
Because of all this, in one of my own contexts, I had to bump up the 
SMTP timeout to 60 seconds to allow for sending a large email on a slow
network; otherwise, the send failed with an exception and an error pop-up.
Change likewise if and as needed for your context.  Ideally, the mail 
server timeouts would be configurable in the <I>mailconfig</I> module 
instead of in executable source code files, but they were added after
publication when larger-scale changes in book code listings were no 
longer possible (examples in books are ultimately meant to be demonstrative,
and don't enjoy, and may not even warrant, the level of update flexibility 
common to software at large).  Also ideally, Python's email library modules' 
APIs would support different timeout settings for different operations as 
mentioned above, but this will have to await a core developer's attention.  
For better and worse, software dependencies make your software, well, dependent.

<H2>[Jan-9-11] Minor usability tweaks for PyEdit: suggested changes, (1 patched in 1.2)</H2>

<P>
<I>(Update Oct-19-11: per the <A HREF="#pymailguiall">release</A> description above,
one of the otems here (focus loss) was patched in release 1.2 of the examples package,
as well as in reprints of  the book itself.  See the formal <A HREF="focuspatch">patch</A> 
description ahead.)</I>

<P>
Chapter 11's PyEdit text editor is a large program with lots of functionality,
which I use nearly every day in one context or another.  Besides text edits, 
it's also a key component in the book's PyMailGUI email client.  Still, like 
most non-trivial user interfaces, there are plenty of ways its interaction might 
be customized or improved, depending on its users' preferences.  After using it 
recently with the more critical eye afforded by the passage of time, five items
seem prime candidates for improvement; all are minor nits and not bugs,
but would be simple to improve:

<UL>
<LI>
<B><I>Respond to Enter in some dialogs.</I></B>
It might be nice if some of the nonmodal popup dialogs (Change, Grep, and 
so on) would respond to Enter key presses too, instead of requiring button
clicks for activation as they do now.  This should be easy to add, by 
binding a keyboard event on these dialogs; see earlier in the GUI part's
chapters and examples for pointers on <B>bind</B> method events.
<BR><BR>

<LI>
<B><I>Show CWD in Grep dialog.</I></B>
In the new Grep dialog, a threaded and Unicode-aware file and directory 
searcher, the root directory is preset to ".", meaning the current working 
directory (CWD).  In retrospect, this might be better set to the full 
<B>os.getcwd()</B> path, as it's not always obvious where the program was
started ("." may not mean much if you don't know which program opened the 
editor interface).  The downside here is that the absolute path might be a
bit long for this dialog to display well.  Of course, allowing a full 
regular expression pattern for the search key would be nicer too, but 
this potential upgrade is noted in the book already. 
<BR><BR>

<LI>
<B><I>Disabling Unicode prompt popups.</I></B>
As shipped, the textConfig module configures PyEdit to always ask for a 
Unicode encoding on Opens and Saves, when the encoding type is unknown
(and prefills with the platform default as a suggestion).  It was shipped 
this way because of PyEdit's role in Chapter 14's PyMailGUI, where the 
Unicode encoding of some text items in email may be unknown; the best the 
system can do is ask.  Still, for most standalone use cases, it's a 
bit of a bother to have to OK the Unicode encoding prompt dialog for every 
Open and new Save, when the platform default will apply most (or all) of 
the time.  To disable the Unicode encoding prompt popups and apply the 
platform's encoding default to your text files, simply change the values
of variables <B>opensAskUser</B> and <B>savesAskUser</B> from True to False 
in file <B>textConfig.py</B>.  See that file's comments and the book for 
details.
<BR><BR>

<LI>
<B><I><A name="focusnote">Text loses focus after Unicode prompt popups (patched in 1.2).</A></I></B>
As coded, the Unicode prompt popups issued on Opens and Saves may cause 
focus to be lost: you may need to click once in the text area before you 
can start typing text or navigating with arrow keys, though not if you next 
use scrollbars or view.  This is a minor annoyance at worst, but seems to stem
from a buglet in the standard dialogs used for the popups (they should ideally
save and restore focus, as other standard dialogs do).  It's also a non-issue 
if you disable these Unicode popups altogether per the prior note's suggestion.  
To force the issue for all cases, though, it's trivial to add a call to 
<B>self.text.focus()</B> just after the dialog calls in the Open and Save callback
handler methods; see the Find and Goto dialog handlers for more hints.  This
is assuming that focus is a desired feature, of course; in some cases, users 
might proceed to scrollbars instead of arrow keys after an Open, and view 
rather than edit.
<BR><BR>

<I><B><U>Update Feb-1-11</U></B></I>: This is trivial to improve, so I'm posting this to 
be patched in book reprints and the next book example package release (1.2).  Please
see the <A HREF="#focuspatch">patch details</A> below. 
<BR><BR>

<LI>
<B><I>Clone might be better in the File menu.</I></B>
The Clone action, which creates a new, independent edit window, is currently 
located in the Tools menu.  To some, it might seem more typical and prominent 
in the File menu instead.  Moving it to File has a subtle downside, though: 
because the File menu is removed (or disabled) when PyEdit is used in attached 
component mode, Clone would be unavailable.  For instance, in Chapter 14's 
PyMailGUI email client, the PyEdit component has a Clone in Tools which currently 
works fine -- it creates a new PyEdit in a new Toplevel window, with the Frame-based 
menus used in component mode.  This can be useful for saving bits of text cut 
from the mail message, and so on.  Clone works the same in Chapter 11's PyView, 
though its role there seems less compelling.  Still, moving Clone implies tradeoffs.

</UL>

<P>
Because PyEdit is a book example, written and provided in easily scriptable 
Python code, I'll leave applying these items as suggested exercise, along
with anything else you might care to tweak.  This is Python, after all.

<H2><A name="shelvenote">[Feb-1-11] Shelves close() calls for non-update script in Example 1-19? (No)</A></H2>

<P>
A reader posted an errata report for this book on O'Reilly's site, which 
claimed that a <B>db.close()</B> call is required to avoid file corruption 
at the end of a Chapter 1 script that displays but does not update a shelve.
Per the report, the shelve file triggers errors later, after it is updated 
by the next script and then displayed again.  Here is the post's text:

<PRE>
Type: Minor technical mistake
Description: There are no page numbers when using the Kindle version of 
the text.

In the discussion of building dictionaries using classes, Example 1-19 
(dump_db_classes.py) requires closing the db at the end of the script.  
The final line of the code example should be:

db.close()

If the db is not closed, the subsequent updating (Example 1-20) and then 
re-printing of the db (using dump_db_classes.py again) will fail, giving 
an error code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python31\dump_db_classes.py", line 6, in <module>
    print(key, '=>\n', db[key].name, db[key].pay)
  File "C:\Python31\lib\shelve.py", line 113, in __getitem__
    value = Unpickler(f).load()
EOFError
</PRE>

<P>
I have not been able to reproduce this error, and suspect that the poster's
kindle cut-and-paste simply dropped the close() call that appears at the end of 
the update script in Example 1-20.  In my testing, the scripts in question work 
without error and as shown, both in Python 3.1 (using the "dumb" DBM file 
interface default in 3.X), as well as in Python 2.7 (using the bundled "bsddb" 
file interface default in 2.X).  Moreover, these examples worked fine under 
Python 2.5 for the prior edition of this book, and similar scripts have been 
used successfully in earlier editions dating back to 1995.  In general, shelves
should not require close() calls unless the shelve has been updated.  By this 
rule, a close() is not required in Example 1-19 (though it wouldn't hurt if 
added); however, all shelve update scripts in the book do call close() before
exiting as required.

<P>
Because I can't reproduce this issue, I'm posting this as a clarification
instead of a correction for now, barring a more detailed reader report.
If you do see the same error, please email me with full context; the platform, 
Python version, and underlying DBM interface in use may factor into behavior
too, and there are too many possible combinations for me to test exhaustively.  
In the poster's defense, shelves are notoriously error-prone; it's not impossible
that file paths may have differed between scripts (the current working directory
can sometimes change unexpectedly in IDLE), or that a bad cut-and-paste 
dropped the close() call in either the creation script of Example 1-18 or the
update script of Example 1-20.

<P>
<I>Update</I>: The reader who posted this note was later unable to reproduce
the error in question by repeating the steps which led to it, but believes 
it existed initially.  That may close the case, though there are too many
variables related to shelves to be certain.

As is, it works on the test platform used for the book, and likely works on

However, this is timing and platform dependent, and may fail on some machines

"<B>test-cgiu-uploads-bug*</B>" should read 
"<B>test-cgi-uploads-bug*</B>",
and the bullet item text
"<B>test-cgi-uploads-bug.html/py saves the input stream</B>" should read 
"<B>test-cgi-uploads-bug2.html/py saves the input stream</B>".

<B>Page 1555, top of page, quotes are misplaced in heading line</B><BR>
A typo inherited from the prior edition: the quotes and question mark
in the heading line at the very top of this page are slightly off.  Change the
heading line:
<B>So What's "Python: The Sequel"?</B> to read as:
<B>"So What's Python?": The Sequel</B>.  Quotes are angled in the original
and revision.  This header refers back to the 
sidebar in the Preface titled "So What's Python?".  Arguably trivial,
as this sidebar was 1500 pages (and perhaps a few months) ago by this
point in the book, but it would be better to get this right.  This header
was broken by a copyedit change on the prior edition, and fell through the
cracks on this one.

<LI><B><A name="filenamespatch">Pages 978 and 964, encode and decode i18n attachment filenames for display, save, send</A></B><BR>
Per the <A HREF="#filenames">detailed description above</A>, the following two changes will 
support both receipt and send of encoded i18n attachment filenames, assuming that such non-ASCII
filenames are valid on the underlying platform (Windows is very liberal in this regard).  
<B>First</B>, on Page 978, change the very last line of the <B>partName</B> method def statement 
from the first of these to the second (this is mid page at code line 26, in file 
PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailParser.py):
<PRE>
        return (filename, contype)

        return (self.decodeHeader(filename), contype) # oct 2011: decode i18n fnames
</PRE>

<B>Second</B>, on Page 964, change the 5th and 4th last lines of the <B>addAttachments</B> method def 
statement from the first of these to the second
(this is mid page line -22, in file PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailSender.py):
<PRE>
            # set filename and attach to container
            basename = os.path.basename(filename)

            # set filename (ascii or utf8/mime encoded) and attach to container
            basename = self.encodeHeader(os.path.basename(filename))   # oct 2011
</PRE>

<B><I>Update Oct-19-11</I></B>: Patched in version 1.3 of the book examples package (PP4E-Examples-1.3.zip),
and scheduled to be applied in future reprints of the book itself.
