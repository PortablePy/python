This site implements a simple web-browser interface to POP/SMTP email
accounts.  Anyone can send email with this interface, but for security
reasons, you cannot view email unless you install the scripts with your
own email account information, in your own server account directory.
PyMailCgi is implemented as a number of Python-coded CGI scripts that run on
a server machine (not your local computer), and generate HTML to interact 
with the client/browser.  See the book <I>Programming Python, 3rd Edition</I>
for more details.</P>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<P>Caveats: PyMailCgi 1.0 was initially written during a 2-hour layover at 
Chicago's O'Hare airport.  This release is not nearly as fast or complete 
as PyMailGUI (e.g., each click requires an Internet transaction, there
is no save operation or multithreading, and there is no caching of email 
headers or already-viewed messages).  On the other hand, PyMailCgi runs on 
any web broswer, whether you have Python (and Tk) installed on your machine
or not.  
     
<P>Also note that if you use these scripts to read your own email, PyMailCgi
does not guarantee security for your account password. See the notes in the 
View action page as well as the book for more information on security policies. 

<p><I><U>New in Version 2</U></I>: PyMailCGI now supports viewing and sending email
attachments for a single user, and avoids some of the prior version's exhaustive mail 
downloads. It only fetches message headers for the list page, and only downloads the 
full text of the single message selected for viewing. 

<p><I><U>New in Version 2.1</U></I>: Deletions perform server inbox synchronization
tests to ensure that the mail displayed is the only one deleted. In rare cases,
the inbox may change in ways that invalidate message numbers after mail is fetched.
2.1 makes deletions safe, but index lists may still become out of synch.

        implements a more complete client-side Python+Tk email GUI
<li>The <I>pymail.py</I> program in the Email directory, which 
        provides a simple console command-line email interface
<li>The Python imaplib module which supports the IMAP email protocol
        instead of POP
