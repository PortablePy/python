<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
O'Reilly published the 3rd edition of the book <i>Programming Python</i> 
in August, 2006. This 1500-page edition is an updated and expanded version of the
<A href="about-pp2e.html">2nd Edition</a>, with new material on GUIs, systems programming, 
Internet scripting, databases, C integration, and more.  

<p>Although it has been expanded and revised, this third edition retains the 
applications-programming focus of the prior edition. It's about what you can do with
Python after you've learned the core language. As a gradual tutorial for applications 
work, this edition is designed to be a natural follow-up to the language fundamentals 
book <A href="about-lp2e.html"><i>Learning Python</i></A>, and augmented by the reference
book <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythonpr3/"><i>Python Pocket Reference</i></A>.

<p>Given its in-depth coverage of each of its target domains, this edition is
essentially like 4 or 5 books in one.  It comes with some 350 pages on GUIs, 500 on 
Internet programming, and so on. Along the way, larger development concepts such as 
OOP and code reuse are put into action in practical and realistically-scaled programs
you'll want to refer to and use.

This page will be expanded with resources for readers in the future. For now, see 
the following links for more details on this book.  One detail worth noting: 
on O'Reilly's page, you'll notice that they sell this edition in both paper and
PDF file forms; the latter is convenient for searching and cut and paste of 
code, and when you don't want to carry around a 1500+ page book.
