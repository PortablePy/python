Run dump* to display dbase contents in textual form,
verify* to verify or reject unverified records, and 
backup* to make a gzip tar file dbase backup.  All 3

programs; full-blown Tkinter or CGI interfaces, as well 
as converters between flat file and shelve storage 
mediums are left as an exercise.
