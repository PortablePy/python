# implement inventory/buyer databases as persistent shelve/pickle files;
# since the validations are already coded to use a function call interface,
# we just map those calls back to the shelve or pickled object here--no 
# need to change validations code;  caveat: some dbm flavors may need a 
# Inventory.close() call, and this scheme doesn't support concurrent dbase
# access--shelves must be locked if concurrent access is possible (see 
# flock() in the PyErrata example in the Internet chapter), and we would
# want to load the Buyers list from its file on each buyers() call;
#
# note that shelves require string keys (not ints), but we load raw
# strings from the order data file, so no conversions are necessary here;
# Buyers could be a shelve with all values = None if the list grows long:
# that would replace the 'in' test with a shelve index (but may be slower,
# since it adds a file access);  Inventory could almost be a simple dbm 
# file instead of a shelve, but that requires mapping integer values to 
# and from strings (dbm values must be strings--see persistence chapter);
