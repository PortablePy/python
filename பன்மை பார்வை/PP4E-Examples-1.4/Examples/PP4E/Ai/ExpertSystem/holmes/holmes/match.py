# module match.py
#
# pattern matcher (unification without nested terms)
#
# see holmes.doc for descriptions
# exports all procedures here
# substitute supports general trees; match does not;
# substitute copies a term with variables evaluated;
# ground evaluates a variable, returning its binding;
# match returns a tuple: 
#   (success - 0|1, bindings = [(name, dict),..])
#
# note:
# we need to test for ground variables ending at the 
# same free variable (dictionary entry(), to avoid
# cycles (binding a variable to itself;  2 free vars
# are the same if their (name, dict) bindings are
# the 'same'  -> the name is equivalent, and the
# dict is the _exact_ same object;  we must use 
# 'is' to test if the dicts are the same, since:
#       if not v1 == v2
# compares the tuple and their nested dicts recursively,
# and by values: 
#       (x, dict1)  would == (x, dict2)
# if dict1 and dict2 happen to have the same var/value
# bindings in them, even thouhg they are diff dicts/envs;
#
# note:
# we can't use 'is' (pointer eq) to test atom/symbol
# equality (must use string '==' lexical eq);  this is
# because pythin does not store all strings in a single
# global hash table (each scope has it's own string
# table, so temp strings can be reclaimed on func
# exits, etc.);  we may fix this later, but we could
# make our own atom table here (using a pythin 
# dictionary) to acheive the same effect (though
# the extra insertion cost may negate the 'is' gain);
