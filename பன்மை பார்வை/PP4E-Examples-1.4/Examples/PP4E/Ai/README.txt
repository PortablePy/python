This directory contains two AI (Artificial Intelligence) examples that
are mentioned but not covered in any sort of depth in the text.

PLEASE NOTE: The portions of these examples that are used and named
in the 4th Edition of the book have been ported to Python 3.X, but 
others might not have been.  PyToe was ported to 3.X, but holmes was 
not.  Holmes dates back to pre-1.0 Python, and would be substantially 
different if coded today--see its own README for more details.


1) PyToe
========
A ticTacToe GUI program, described but not fully listed in the 
_Larger GUI Examples_ chapter.  This is a new program (developed
in the 1999-2000 timeframe) written for the 2nd edition of this book.
It demonstrates basic game search strategies (you play the program).


2) Holmes
=========
The holmes expert system is briefly mentioned to show its rule parser 
logic in the _Text and Language_ chapter.  I don't maintain holmes 
anymore, but it seems to still work as advertised under Python 1.5.2.
If memory serves, holmes dates back to 1993 and pre-1.0 Python releases,
so please note that it is very old code, and not necessarily a good 
coding style example (e.g., it does not use class constructor methods,
as they weren't available when holmes was written).

Below are example Holmes sessions to get you started (this was all
run under Python 1.5.2).  It uses the following holmes interactive
commands:

    += adds a rule
    @@ prints the rulebase
    ?- does backward chaining to prove a query
    +- does forward chaining with a set of facts
    @= loads a rulebase file
    stop exits holmes
    help prints all commands
