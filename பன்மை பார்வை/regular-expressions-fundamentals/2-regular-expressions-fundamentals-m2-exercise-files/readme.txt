/**
 * Simple javascript based regular expression tester.
 * Demo file belonging with the Pluralsight Regular Expressions Fundamentals course.
 *
 * -------------------------------
 * This is a simple regex testing tool using javascript.
 * This means that it will *only* support basic regex syntaxes and modifiers.
 * More advanced syntaxes, such as for instance Unicode shortcodes are not supported.
 * 
 * As this tool was only created for demonstration purposes, it does not contain
 * regex syntax checking or validation. Nor does it support replace or split operations.
