<span id="preferences"></span><h1>Defaults and Preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#defaults-and-preferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Early in the development of PAGE, I considered dropping completely the
preference stuff derived from Visual Tcl primarily because many of
the preferences were related to functions that do not have meaning for
PAGE.  However, I really disliked the gray background in PAGE and
wanted to change it to my favorite background color - wheat.  Also, I
felt that capability should be shared with the users. Having made that
decision, I saw that it was then a small step to consider allowing the user to
have one color scheme for running PAGE, while generating a Python GUI
with a different color scheme.  A similar progression of thoughts has
occurred with respect to fonts; it started because the default fonts
are too small for my elderly eyes.  So one thing led to another and
it became a question of where to stop.   I
implemented color schemes consisting of foreground and background
colors as well as separate fonts for PAGE and the generated GUI.  I am
also trying to provide reasonable highlight coloring.  I try to
provide helpful information in the generated code so that you will be
able to see what I am trying to do and thus be able to customize your
results.</p>
<p>An addition argument for manipulating colors is that by
not exploiting colors, one is not really exploiting Tk. Not
really understanding ttk styles at all well, I ask that if you find
better ways or even a way of doing something which eludes me, please
let me know, I will be happy to use it, and secondly, hating to try
imposing my stylistic tastes, I again welcome comments.  Also let me
say, I have done most of my development and testing with light colors,
in particular the color wheat. That means that things can be expected
to work better with light colors.  I have also tested and tried to
make things work with a blue background and white foreground.</p>
<p>Let me clarify what is meant by defaults and preferences
here. Defaults are built-in attribute values which will be used for
colors, background and foreground, and font selection and sizes unless
the PAGE user sets them specifically for individual GUI widgets.
Defaults also include colors and fonts to be used by PAGE in
displaying its interface windows.  Preferences are user specified
overrides for some of the attributes used throughout by PAGE.
Individual widget attributes can be changed using the Attribute
Editor.</p>
<p>Defaults can be derived from several sources.  First, if nothing else
is done, then the small gray world of Tk defaults prevail.  These
defaults may be overridden by values in the rc file which is usually
.pagerc which was
saved from previous executions of PAGE where user preferences for the
default values were made.  Those saved preferences can
always be respecified and saved.  The third source of overriding GUI
defaults comes into play when the PAGE user specifies or opens an
existing generated GUI “.tcl” file. In that case the defaults for
further GUI development match those in effect when the file was saved.
That is, when you open up an existing GUI “.tcl” for further
development PAGE will use the GUI defaults that were in effect at the
earlier time when the GUI was created, while PAGE ignores current
default settings. This third way is a version 4.0 enhancement.</p>
<p>Confusion stems from at least two sources.  First, there is really two
sets of preferences, (1) those for the PAGE program, and (2) the
preferences to be used for the generated GUI.  Another source is that
there are multiple ways of specifying preferences within the Tk
environment. In the case of ttk widgets, one must use Themes and
Styles to manipulate colors and fonts but, unfortunately, there are a
number of aspects which are undocumented, complementing some serious
shortcomings in the implementation or design of the ttk code.  Through
experimentation and googling I have found some things that work. Once
again, I received tremendous help from Guilherme Polo in solving
important questions in my use of ttk styles. Even now there are some
disturbing artifacts in PAGE associated with my implementation. Again,
suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, that things will be easier for the user if he
sticks with the defaults.  But then one is stuck with a dull gray
world with small print on Linux and Microsoft PC’s. (I think that the
Tk default gray is #d9d9d9 also known as the X11 color gray9.)</p>
<p>Lets start with the easy preferences. PAGE has several simple
preferences such as whether on not to use automatically generated
aliases or relative placement (see <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#relative"><span class="std std-ref">Relative Placement</span></a>) and the
granularity of the grid upon which a widget is placed. Those are easy
and could even be dropped as user settable options. They were
included when new features were added to PAGE but now I am almost
excursively sticking with the new features and rarely test whether the
older stuff still works correctly. So I recommend that you stick with
the initial settings.  Recently, a user pointed me to a problem with
Relative Placement and so I went back and did some additional testing
and debugging with absolute placement and so I feel more confident
with absolute placement. (If you uncheck the item “Generate Python
with relative placement” you get absolute placement.) At the same time
I generated a hack which lessen the relative placement problem with
label frames.</p>
<p>The option dealing with <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#origin"><span class="std std-ref">default origin</span></a> is one
where the user actually might or might not want, so it really belongs
as a preference.</p>
<p>Preferences are trickier in the case of the generated GUI because one
is choosing default values which may not be available to the user of
the generated application when the application is executed on a
different operating system from the development system. The same fonts
and colors might not be available on both systems.  You might accept
some defaults with respect to PAGE, but really want control over
things like colors and fonts to be used in your application.  I am
doing my development work on Linux and am oriented toward that
operating system.</p>
<p>Finally, I have the question as to which defaults I set before you
have made any preferences known.  Although I do not like them, I have
set up PAGE to use Tk default colors and fonts. That is, PAGE uses as
the default background for ttk widgets - #d9d9d9. So select
File-&gt;Preferences and make the program behave best for you.</p>
<p>Note that when one makes changes in the Preferences, they are
committed when one selects the check mark in the upper right. At the
same time they are written to the .pagerc file to be utilized the next
time the user invokes PAGE.  If the user wants to abandon actions
taken in the Preferencs window, he selects the stylized “x” next to
the check and the whole window disappears and nothing is saved.  In
PAGE several variables derived from the preferences are set at the
initiation of the program. If you want to change preferences, I
definitely recommend opening PAGE, making your preference changes,
saving them by selecting the check mark, and then exiting PAGE.  When
you restart they should be in effect.</p>
<p>One gotcha remains.  If you start a project where you specified one
color scheme and saved the project in the GUI “.tcl” file, then
changed a color or font preference and then reloaded the tcl file you
will find that the original color and font preferences are still in
effect; they are saved within the “.tcl”. I emphasize this because I
have been caught by it.</p>
<p>There is a preference which allows the user to specify the indentation
width in spaces. This is like specifying tab width but PAGE does not
use tabs for storing Python files.  Again, Python modules will be
saved using spaces. The default for the indentation width is four
spaces. Like other preferences this preference is stored in the
“.pagerc” file.</p>
<p>When balloon help (tooltips) was implemented and the default font is
tiny, so a preference has been added for specifying a tooltip font.</p>
<p>A preference has been added for specifying the Python
command for execution in the Python Console.</p>
<p><strong>When preference changes are required, one should use a separate PAGE
session to make the changes.</strong> So open PAGE, make your changes, and
quit.  That will ensure that everything is properly initialized.</p>
<div class="section" id="preferences-windows">
<h2>Preferences Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you go to File-&gt;Preferences in the main PAGE menu you bring up a
the Preferences notebook window with three pages.  The Basics page:</p>
<img alt="_images/basics.png" src="_images/basics.png" />
<p>This page allows one to make several miscellaneous preference
choices. My recommendation is that they be left the way they
are. Relative placement and aliases are described elsewhere in this
document.</p>
<p id="py-cmd">One area which is confusing is the specification of the Python command
and the IDE command, because, no surprise, things behave differently
in Windows than in UNIX-like systems.</p>
<p>It seems that Linux, when installing Python 3, creates the command
python3 to differentiate execution between Python 2 and
Python 3. Python 2 is often installed for legacy programs. Starting
with PAGE 6.1, the default Python command is python3.</p>
<p>Windows 10 does not, by default, install Python, so if I install
Python 3.9 from the Microsoft Store, it will install several
executables including python.exe, pythonw.exe, python3.9.exe, and
pythonw3.9.exe. I can use “python”, “pythonw”, “python3.9”, and “pythonw3.9”
as the Python command.  Also installed was python3.exe but I cannot get
“python3” or “C:&lt;Installation directory&gt;python3.exe” to work as the
Python command even though “python3 &lt;GUI module&gt;” when executed cmd
window does execute.</p>
<p>The situation with “idle” under Windows is also a trial. I found that
the installation from the Microsoft Store installs idle.exe,
idle3.exe, and idle3.9.exe. I could use only idle3.9 as the IDE
command in the Preference window. I prefer emacs as my IDE and so I
installed emacs on Windows 10 and use the full path
“c:\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe” successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="color-preferences">
<h2>Color Preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#color-preferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/colors.png" src="_images/colors.png" />
<p>The top section deals with colors displayed while executing PAGE. The
most important is the PAGE Background Color which is the background
color for all the PAGE windows. One makes a new selection by invoking
the <a class="reference internal" href="interface.html#color-dialog"><span class="std std-ref">Apply Window</span></a> by selecting the “Browse colors …” button to
the right of the page. This open the Color Dialog and one can set the
color as described above.  To go back to the default color, select the
“Default Color” button.</p>
<p>The next row allows the user to set the foreground color, that is
necessary in case he selects a dark background such as dark blue.  In
that case, a light colored foreground color should be chosen.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, one wants a visible distinction for the widget tree
highlight.  That shows which widget has been chosen in the GUI under
construction.</p>
<p>For GUI colors, it is much the same as above.  I have not seen a
requirement for specifying a default highlight color.  If that is
necessary please let me know and I will see if I can implement it in a
future version.  I have wanted to have the menu in the top level
window be in a distinctive color band so I support that feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="font-preferences">
<h2>Font Preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#font-preferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/fonts.png" src="_images/fonts.png" />
<p>Since my eyes require large fonts like 16 point fonts, I can set the
PAGE default font which catches most of the right things.  For the
Python Console window I want a big bold font; that is the PAGE fixed
width font.</p>
<p>The GUI fonts are more numerous. In addition to the ones above, one
can specify the text font which is used in widgets like text boxes and
list boxes.  Again, I allow one to specify a menu font which is
different from the default.</p>
<p>One question I had related to the choice of fonts for text boxes.
Should the font be the text font or fixed width font?  If one wants to
build an editor in a text box as is the case with the PAGE Python
Console, then a fixed width font is desired, but if one wants to
display something like a help message then a variable width font is
more appropriate.  What I did for PAGE was use the GUI text font for
text boxes and the GUI fixed width font for list boxes.  In truth,
good arguments for using all three fonts for list boxes can be made.</p>
<p>Fonts have caused me much anguish and confusion.  One may pick a font
which works well on the system where PAGE is hosted.  Then one could
build a GUI which would call for specific fonts which are not
available on the target system. If you know what fonts are available
on the target system you can pick the fonts you like. Tk encapsulates
a set of standard fonts that are always available, and of course the
standard widgets use these fonts. This helps abstract away platform
differences.  The predefined fonts are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>TkDefaultFont    The default for all GUI items not otherwise specified.</li>
<li>TkTextFont       Used for entry widgets, listboxes, etc.</li>
<li>TkFixedFont      A standard fixed-width font.</li>
<li>TkMenuFont       The font used for menu items.</li>
<li>TkHeadingFont    The font typically used for column headings in lists and tables.</li>
<li>TkCaptionFont    A font for window and dialog caption bars.</li>
<li>TkSmallCaptionFont       A smaller caption font for subwindows or tool dialogs</li>
<li>TkIconFont       A font for icon captions.</li>
<li>TkTooltipFont    A font for tooltips.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The following python program (Python 3) will display the characteristics of the
default fonts:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tkinter</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tkinter.font</span>

<span class="n">root</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tkinter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Tk</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">fonts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tkinter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">font</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">font</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">fonts</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">font</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">root</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;font&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;configure&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">font</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It may also be the case that if a chosen font is not available on the
target system then one of these fonts may be used.  I can’t tell from
the documentation.  The preferences window allows one to specify the
default fonts used in the generated GUI. To avoid too much gilding of
the lily, I have allowed the user to specify only the first four as
well as the text font for the Scrolledtreeview widget. If
you try different fonts for one of the defaults and then want to
return to the true default such as TkFixedFont for the text widgets,specified
there is a button for that.</p>
<p>You can specify a default font to be used and still specify different
non-default fonts for any individual widget. For instance, you can use
TkMenuFont for a Button widget if you want or in my case a 14 point
font.  There seems to be another weirdness in Tk to be avoided and
that is you can change the family, size, weight, etc. of the defaults
fonts; at least I have not made that easy.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using the GUI application on the system hosting
PAGE by all means select defaults that meet you requirements.  But
remember those fonts may not be there if the GUI executes on a
different system. In which case, the Tk will pick defaults for you and
that may not be what you want.</p>
<p>If a default font is active for a widget, it will appear in the
Attribute Editor with the default name such as TkMenuFont but if you
select the adjoining ellipsis key the font will be changed to a new
font with the characteristics specified by family, size, weight, etc..
That may not be what you want, in which case you can replace the font
name with the default font name.</p>
<p>On Fonts tab of the Preferences window a font selection has been added
for the font to be used with the Treeview widget.  The default font
here is TkDefaultFont.</p>
<p>Be aware that selecting one of the Tk predefined fonts is different
from selecting the corresponding description. For instance, the font
description of TkDefaultFont is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(‘-family’, ‘sans-serif’, ‘-size’, -12, ‘-weight’, ‘normal’, ‘-slant’, ‘roman’, ‘-underline’, 0, ‘-overstrike’, 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>on my Linux system, while on Windows 10 the
TkDefaultFont is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(‘-family’, ‘Segoe UI’, ‘-size’, 9, ‘-weight’, ‘normal’, ‘-slant’,
‘roman’, ‘-underline’, 0, ‘-overstrike’, 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the font description
instead of “TkDefaultFont” everything will look fine. If you go to
another system which does not have the “san-serif” font family things
may look different from the TkDefaultFont on that system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profile-and-themes">
<h2>Profile and Themes<a class="headerlink" href="#profile-and-themes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, PAGE open an rc file as an initialization file. In
the context of Unix-like systems, the term rc stands for the phrase
“run commands”. The term is used for any file that contains startup
information for a command. It is believed to have originated sometime
in 1965 at a runcom facility from the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing
System (CTSS). For page the default rc file is “.pagerc” in the users home
directory. It is a text file and so is editable but that is not a
great idea; hopefully necessary changes can be made using the
Preferences Window.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the usual behavior is for the .pagerc file to be
opened as an initialization file. It contains information regarding
color schemes, font preferences, window locations, and other
preference information. Were I an expansive individual, I might call
it a theme.  I do call it an rc file, a name hallowed in Unix
mythology. Perhaps better, it can be called the “profile”. Normally,
the default location of the rc file is the users home directory. This
is the case if the user has defined the HOME environmental variable.
In the absence of the HOME environmental variable, the location is the
location of the PAGE script. So Windows users hop to and define the
HOME environmental variable!</p>
<p>PAGE has the capability of specifying the rc file or profile to be
used in the page command with the -p parameter. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">page</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">rc_file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or for Windows users:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">winpage</span> <span class="s2">&quot;-p &lt;rc_file&gt;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where &lt;rc_file&gt; is the profile file relative to the HOME directory if
specified or the page script location.</p>
<p>The Preference Window has button labeled “Save as …” which can be
selected to save the rc file with a new name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dark-mode">
<span id="dark"></span><h2>“Dark” mode<a class="headerlink" href="#dark-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dark mode as opposed to light mode seems in fashion these days.  The
impetus seems to be dubious studies on the effects of blue light on
sleeping.  It appears that most people think of light mode as white
background and black foreground while the reverse is dark mode, I like
a light mode with wheat as the background color and black as
foreground. Tk has a light mode with a gray90 background and a black
foreground although they never called it light mode.</p>
<p>As for dark mode I sometimes use a blue background and a yellow
foreground. Also I am surprised how much I like black background, and
orange or cyan foreground.</p>
<p>The color preferences allow to march to your own drummer using almost
any combination that appeals to you. The best way to set up a new mode, is
to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start PAGE</li>
<li>Select Preferences from the Main menu</li>
<li>Chose the colors you want.</li>
<li>Do a Save As entering your name for your color scheme. The generates a
new rc file in your preferred directory. The name can be any name you
choose; I recommend not using a “.” and ending with “rc”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose one color scheme for PAGE windows and another for the
GUI PAGE generates. What you will want to do is choose colors for the
foreground and the background that have a high contrast.  Certain
operations in PAGE depend on calculating whether the background is
light or dark and it doesn’t work perfectly.</p>

contrast is low and hard to read, avoid that color.</p>
<p>Also, the standalone Python program “show_color.py”, also in
“page/color_chart/”, is invoked with the parameter “color”</p>
