<h1>The PAGE Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#the-page-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section discusses the menus and several of the windows in the
PAGE interface.  Again, the PAGE interface is a modified version of the
Visual Tcl interface.  It was modified because some of the original
facilities and features of Visual Tcl are inappropriate for PAGE or
because the Visual Tcl documentation is in such a sad state that I
cannot decipher them.</p>
<p>When PAGE is executed initially, a number of windows are spread across
the screen in what may appear as random locations and sizes. I have
arranged near the corners and the edges so that they will be out of
the way of the GUI you are building.  They should then be resized and
moved to more desirable locations.  Follow such placement with Main
Menu selections such as Windows-&gt;Save Window Locations or File-&gt;Quit
and the geometry of the windows will be saved in the .pagerc file and
used when PAGE is next invoked.</p>
<p>Many PAGE parameters are are saved from one invocation of PAGE to the
next in the file “HOME/.pagerc”. Included are the preferences and the
geometry (size and location) of the various windows in the page
interface as described above. This file is saved when the user does
a quit.</p>
<p>Start PAGE by executing ‘page’ on Linux, winpage.bat in a DOS window,
or activating the PAGE icon on the Windows desktop. The page and
winpage.bat scripts may specify a filename. If the filename includes
an extension, it must be “.tcl”; in the case of no extension or a
final “.”, the extension “.tcl” will be assumed.</p>
<p>The default interface for PAGE presents small font sizes and the Tk
default scheme of black on gray. So for my personal use I made the
fonts larger and wanted the background color Wheat. See the section on
<a class="reference internal" href="preferences.html#preferences"><span class="std std-ref">Defaults and Preferences</span></a>.</p>
<p>PAGE may be terminated with File-&gt;Quit which cleanly stops execution
while saving preferences and window geometry; Control-Q also quits
PAGE cleanly.</p>
<p>With release 4.18, most of the PAGE windows shown below have
scrollbars which appear only when necessary and may be adjusted with
the scroll wheel when the mouse is over the scrolled field as well as
when over the scrollbar itself.</p>
<p>Several of the PAGE windows have a check mark in the upper right
corner of the window.  This mark hides the window, i.e., the window
exists but is not visible on the screen.  In hiding the window the
contents may be applied, for example changes made in the Preferences
Window will be applied.  In other cases it may be nothing to apply as
with the Callback Window.  The windows may be mapped, or made visible,
from the Main Menu.</p>
<p>Many of the interface images below have the background color “wheat”
because I have specified that color in my color preferences.</p>
<div class="section" id="main-menu">
<h2>Main Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#main-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Main menu appears in the window:</p>
<img alt="_images/main-menu.png" src="_images/main-menu.png" />
<p>In the File submenu the Save command and the Save As… command behave
a little unexpectedly. Both commands only save the current project
even if there are lender GUI’s open.  The Save As command always saves
the current project while the Save command only saves the current
project if the current project has been changed.  The Borrow command
is new and is described in the section on <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#reuse"><span class="std std-ref">Reuse</span></a>.  The New
command replaces the current GUI toplevel with a new toplevel Giving
the user the option of saving the old one if it contains changes.</p>
<p>In OS X the menubar does not appear in the main window; instead
it appears in the menubar at the top of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menus">
<span id="menu"></span><h2>Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main menu of PAGE contains some of the usual stuff and there is
nothing too surprising in the File, or Edit.</p>
<p>A couple of points about the Window submenu that helps. There are
several PAGE windows which appear for various functions and the user
can relocate them, hide and retrieve them, and change their sizes and
location. The selections above the separator causes the respective
windows to appear at their default co-ordinates. This can be helpful
when using multiple displays and then going back to a single display.</p>
<p>The Save Window Locations item in the Window menu saves the current
locations for future invocations of PAGE. Quitting PAGE does also
saves the current window locations.</p>
<p>The Widget menu is a context menu, a popup menu, providing functions
depending on the widget selected. The popup menu is activated by
selecting a widget from either the GUI window or the Widget Tree with
Button-3. It allows the invocation of things like the Menu editor, or
Page editor for the TNotebook widget. It also allows the user to do
stuff like cut, copy, paste, and delete the widget. A new facility in
4.8 is to expand a widget to fill its container. Finally, it opens the
Binding Editor. The top element of the popup menu selects a submenu
containing commands appropriate to the widget.</p>
<p>The Widget popup appears below:</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-menu.png" src="_images/widget-menu.png" />
<p>An alternate popup is associated with multi-select widgets:</p>
<img alt="_images/alt-popup.png" src="_images/alt-popup.png" />
<p>The Gen_Python menu creates the Python code for the GUI module as well
as the supporting module. It also loads existing modules into Python
Console windows or into a user specified IDE.</p>
<p>Finally, the Help menu opens an About window containing some
information about PAGE and can open the html version of the this
documentation in the default browser. This has been tested in Linux
with Firefox and Chrome, in OSX with Firefox and Safari, and XP with
Firefox (I don’t have a reasonable version of IE).</p>
<p>Let me emphasize that PAGE will contain bugs. So be sure to save
often. That is a purpose of the save commands in the File menu.</p>
<p>Many of interface elements like the Widget Toolbar, the Attribute
Editor, and the Widget Tree can be turned on from the Window item of
the main toolbar. Others are invoked from the widget menu after a
widget is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-toolbar">
<h2>Widget Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Toolbar is where one obtains widgets for inclusion in the
GUI. One begins building a GUI by selecting Toplevel with Button-1 and
a blank toplevel window appears on the screen.  To add widgets to the
toplevel, click on the widget in the toolbar and then click in the
parent.  The upper left hand corner of the widget appears at the spot
where the user clicked.</p>
<p>The Widget Toolbar appears below:</p>
<img alt="_images/toolbar.png" src="_images/toolbar.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="attribute-editor">
<span id="ae"></span><h2>Attribute Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When one selects a widget the Attribute Editor displays all attributes
of that widget and allows the user to modify those widgets.  Each
attribute row of the attribute editor has three components - a label,
a modifiable field, and a check button.  The plum colored fields are
not modifiable, the others are.  Image fields have orange
backgrounds. They can be modified but don’t.  The image field contains
an image name generated from the file name and may be longer than the
entry field can accommodate and I wanted a way for the user to inspect
the name so I had to make it enabled. If you change it manually you
will get an error message and will have fix things by re-selecting an
image.</p>
<p>When changing an entry field, the new value is entered by hitting the
Enter key or leaving the entry field. If the attribute is will become
a Python variable in the generated code, a check is made to determine
if it is a legal Python identifier. And of course, Unicode characters
are accepted.</p>
<p>Text attributes presented a real challange. When a textvariable
attribute is defined it is no longer possible to change the text
attribute and due to an annomally in the implementation of ttk widgets
the text field is set to zero length and that can make the widget
invisible. The only gymnastics I could devise to make things work
reasonably was to accept the artifact of “::vTcl::” appearing in the
entry field for a variable. You can completely ignore it when
present. You can change the variable by erasing the whole field and
just entering the new value.</p>
<img alt="_images/attribute.jpg" src="_images/attribute.jpg" />
<p>The Alias field is writable by the user.  The user can
provide an alias to improve the readability of the generated code.
Actually, the alias field is used as the class name of the widget in
the generated code and following accepted Python conventions should be
capitalized.</p>
<p id="propagate">The label on the left of an attribute are actually label widgets which
may be selected with Button-3 causing a popup menu to appear allowing
one to reset that attribute to the default value or to apply its
current value to other widgets in the GUI.  For instance, one can
reset the default value of an attribute for the selected widget, all
widgets of the same class in the same toplevel, or all widgets of the
same class in the same container widget.  Similarly, one can propagate
the value of an attribute of the current widget to others of the same
class.  Starting with version 5.1, one can propagate an attribute to
multiple selection widgets.</p>
<p>Invoking the popup menu, posts a menu which uses a submenu. If the
Attribute Editor is close to the right edge of the screen the submenu
over laps the menu and it may be confusing.</p>

<div class="section" id="widget-tree">
<span id="widgettree"></span><h2>Widget Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Tree shows all of widgets created by PAGE and how they are
nested within their parent widgets, see below. The labels in the tree
show the widget class as well as the program alias used in the
generated Python code. If a widget is inside a Plum colored rectangle,
that indicates that the widget is part of the “borrowed” project.
See <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#borrow"><span class="std std-ref">Borrowing Widgets from Existing Projects</span></a>.</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-tree.png" src="_images/widget-tree.png" />
<p>The Widget Tree is a very convenient place to select a widget with
Button-1 especially for selecting widgets within more complex widgets
like TNotebooks. I frequently use this window to select the widget I^^notebook
want to modify and occasionally it fails to select the widget,
particularly when doing copy and paste operations.  For unknown
reasons, if I go and select another widget and then reselect the
widget I want, it usually works.</p>
<p>When you make a change which should appear in the Widget Tree, the
Widget tree may not be updated until you hit the update button in the
upper left of the Widget Tree. The number of such cases has been
reduced.</p>
<p>The “Unselect MS” item in the menu is associated with the multiple
selection function, see <span class="xref std std-ref">multipleselection</span>; it deselects
the multiple selection.</p>
<p>The “Close Borrowed” item in the menu closes all windows of borrowed
projects.</p>
<p>As described below in the section <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#use"><span class="std std-ref">Using PAGE</span></a>, the Widget Tree is very
important when trying to move or select some of the more complex
widgets like paned windows or scrolled windows.</p>
<p>The Widget Tree can be saved as a text file from the Window submenu of
the Main menu bar or by the Alt-f keyboard shortcut. The default file
type is “.tre” (not “.tree” thanks to Windows).</p>
<div class="section" id="double-click-with-button1">
<span id="wt-double"></span><h3>Double Click with Button1<a class="headerlink" href="#double-click-with-button1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When one  double clicks button1 on several window classes
in the GUI toplevel widget, helpful functions are invoked. For
instance, double clicking in a Toplevel widget invokes the menubar
editor. PAGE has updated the function so that double clicking in a
TNotebook or PNotebook invokes the Tab Editor,and double clicking in a
TPainedwindow invokes the Painedwindow Editor.</p>
<p>The Widget Tree has been extended so that double clicking on widget
entries does the same.</p>

different widgets and indicates the ones I find most useful.</p>

<span id="wt-search"></span><h3>Widget Tree Search<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-tree-search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A first attempt at implementing a search function in the Widget Tree
has been implemented. A search entry and search button have been added
at the bottom of the Widget Tree. To do a search you may enter an
expression and the search will be performed when the return key is
pressed and released. All entries will be highlighted and the first
will be visible. The search can also be activated by selecting the
Search button.</p>
<p>The search entry may be either a simple string of characters or a Tcl
regular expression. The search is not case sensitive.</p>
<p>I hope to extend this function in future releases.</p>

<span id="compress"></span><h3>Widget Tree Pruning<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-tree-pruning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are times when the Widget Tree presents an overload of widgets
and it would be helpful if the presentation could be pruned. For
example if the GUI contained multiple toplevel windows and you want to
you want to consecrate on just one. Another example might be a
TNotebook widget which contain several pages each with multiple
widgets and you would like to remove the display of the other
pages.</p>
<p>Pruning can be done by selecting the container widget you would like
to collapse with Shift-Button-1. All that will be displayed is the
container widget followed by the notation “(shell)” to indicate that
there are unseen widgets. A pruned container can be restored to full
display by once again selecting the widget with Shift-Button-1. More
than one container widget may pruned. All pruned containers can be
restored by selecting the “expand” button at the top of the Widget
Tree.</p>

<p>In version 4.6, the IDE entry command has been added to support the

</div>
<div class="section" id="python-console">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Python Console<a class="headerlink" href="#python-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the user generates Python for either the GUI module or the
support module as described above, a separate Python Console window
appears with the generated code inside the upper text box. Thus one
can see both the GUI module and the support module side by side as of
version 4.6.</p>
<p>The Python Console has the following appearance:</p>
<img alt="_images/console.png" src="_images/console.png" />
<p>The upper text box, called the source window, contains the generated
text with a bit of colorization applied; it is editable. The lower
text box contains any generated output from running the source
program. The Python Console is a ttk::panedwindow which allows one to
move the sash between the two text boxes.</p>
<p>Note that upper text widget has a certain editing capability but I do
not recommend it as a Python editor. See the tcl documentation for the
text widget. It is meant for displaying code. If you use it as an
editor you may run into difficulties. In release 4.18 line numbers
were added to the console window and the searching includes the line
numbers as well as the code text. Searching is initiated by either
selecting the Search button or using the Return key in the search
entry field.</p>
<p>To execute the generated Python module, just click on the Run button
of the ‘Python console’.  Unless you have written the necessary
functions not much will happen other than providing a preview of the
GUI. The skeletal functions that are generated automatically for
callbacks displays the function name and any arguments in the
Execution Output window  On Linux or OS X that display  appears
immediately in the execution window; on Windows, when execution is
terminated. As explained in the  <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span class="std std-ref">Rework</span></a> section, the GUI module will
not execute unless there is a existing support module. If the GUI code
has been modified to include new callbacks then one shouldn’t expect
the GUI code to execute until those callbacks have been incorporated
in the support module.</p>
<p>There are several buttons along the bottom of the window. They behave
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Save - Saves the contents of the upper text box into a file. It also
saves the tcl file.</li>
<li>Run - Attempts to execute the GUI source module even if the
displayed code is the Python support module. It also may save the
Python and the tcl file. The shortcut for run is &lt;Control-r&gt;.</li>
<li>Search - Searches the source code for the regular expression in the
entry field to the left. The first search starts at the top of the
console and subsequent searches start where the last left off.</li>
<li>Top - Points the index to the top of the windows so that the next
search will start at the top of the console.</li>
<li>Close - Closes the Python console.  The shortcut is &lt;Control-w&gt;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom frame of the Python console also includes a label between
the Save button and the Run button that will contain a warning,
“Unsaved changes”, when the PAGE detects a change to the source window
since the console was loaded and last saved. The warning is displayed
when Python code is generated or when the source window is edited. The
change detection scheme was changed in version 4.18 in the hope that
fewer false positive indications would occur.</p>
<p>The upper text box can be modified (edited) by selecting a character
position, called the insert cursor, with the mouse and typing. Such
changes will be saved with either the Save button or the Run button in
the GUI console. While the Generate Python window is a text widget
with some editing capability, including the use control-x, control-c,
and control-v for cut, copy, and paste operations. The tcl text widget
has an amazing capabilities for editing but I believe the modification
of generated Python code is best done in a real IDE.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the colorization is not fancy. Keywords, comments,
and strings are set to distinct colors. The defaults are set to
reasonable colors for light backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Run Button attempts a trial run on your GUI. If you have enough
skeleton functions in the support module and there are no errors in
the generated code, you should see the python code executed and the
GUI window will appear. From there you close the Python window go back
to PAGE and refine the GUI by moving widgets around, adding additional
widgets, or changing attributes.</p>
<p>With version 4.13, a search function for the upper window was
added. To utilize, enter a regular expression pattern into the entry
widget to the left of the Search button and select the search button
or the return key in the entry widget. If the search is successful the
string found will be highlighted as above and the insert cursor will
be placed to the immediate right of the found string allowing
successive searches. If an insert cursor is not placed in the upper
window the search starts at the beginning of the window. The regular
expression is a Tcl regular expression because PAGE is written in Tcl
and every implementation of regular expression seems to have subtle
differences</p>
<p>Also, scroll wheel support in the Python console works.  To use the
scroll wheel in Windows one must focus on the desired pane
first. Finally, when the Python Console is in focus, Control-P and
Control-U will have the effect of generating the GUI module and the
supporting module respectively.</p>
<p>Execution of the python module on Linux communicates with the console
through pipes; thus output from the execution now appears immediately
in the Execution Output pane.  Coupled with a recent change which
embeds a print statement in the generated dummy functions, if a user
specifies a command for a button, for example, and generates the
python and runs it from the Python Console, and selects the button,
the name of the command will appear in the Execution Console.  This is
useful because no output from selecting the widget means that you have
not defined a callback function. Unfortunately, on Windows the this
output does not appear until the execution terminates.  (I have not
been able to get Tcl pipes to work with Windows. I would appreciate
help or suggestions.)</p>

<div class="section" id="callback-window">
<h2>Callback Window<a class="headerlink" href="#callback-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Callback Window shows callbacks which have been defined for
elements of the GUI. One may show all of the callbacks defined by
selecting Window-&gt;Show All Bindings from the main menu or just the
bindings for a particular widget by selecting “Callbacks…” from the
Widget popup menu described above.</p>
<p>By double clicking on a callback, the function may be seen in the
Support Console. When invoked this action attempts to load the console
from the support module on disk.  If the support module exists and the
GUI has been changed (using a test that errs on the side of false
positives) a warning message is given.</p>
<img alt="_images/callback.png" src="_images/callback.png" />
<p>In release 4.17, the content of the Callback Window could be either
saved or copied to the clipboard by means of the buttons and the check
button closes the window.  I have since been thinking that was
unnecessary function and removed it in 4.18. Unnecessary because the
content of the entire data window can be selected and pasted into an
editor. If there is strong disagreement, I can reinstate that
function.  Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>The contents of the window can be searched for the regular expression
from the entry field by hitting return key in the entry field or by
selecting the search button. Searching is from the previous search or
the top of the window for the first search.  If the search is
successful the matching string is made the selection. The “Look up”
button will then find the callback function in the Support Console.
The Top button sends the focus to the top of the window. The function
of “Look up” can be initiated with Button-3 over the main window.</p>

<span id="color-dialog"></span><h2>Apply Window<a class="headerlink" href="#apply-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/apply.png" src="_images/apply.png" />
<p>When the user <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#stash"><span class="std std-ref">stashes attribute values</span></a>  for the selected
widget, this window opens and allows one to select the attributes to
propagate using the checkboxes and then to do the actual propagation
from the “Apply” submenu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Color Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many cases where when setting preferences in the Preferences
window or attributes for a widget in the Attribute Editor one selects
a little button with an ellipsis and the invokes a color dialog window:</p>
<img alt="_images/mscolorpicker.png" src="_images/mscolorpicker.png" />
<p>in Windows or</p>
<img alt="_images/colorpicker.png" src="_images/colorpicker.png" />
<p>in other OS’s.</p>
<p>When this window pops up you are given several different ways of
selecting a color:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pick a color in the multicolored window with your mouse.</li>
<li>Enter values in the Red, Green, and Blue entry fields.</li>
<li>Enter an Hex color value such as #f5deb3 in the Color entry
field. That is the color wheat.</li>
<li>Enter a color name such as “wheat” in the Color entry field.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="dual-monitors">
<h2>Dual Monitors<a class="headerlink" href="#dual-monitors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One user reported a problem involving dual monitors where he had
opened PAGE with dual monitors set up with the second monitor to the
right of the main monitor.  He then dragged one of the PAGE windows to
the monitor on the right.  Later he disconnected the second monitor
and reopened PAGE and was unable to see the window displayed on the
nonexistent monitor.  This can now be rescued by selecting the
appropriate window from Main menu -&gt; Window.  I would appreciate any
information from users using Dual monitors.</p>
