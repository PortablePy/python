These examples demonstrates popup menus attach to buttons and activated 
with Button-3.

This directory contains a main example, 'popup" which merely
activates a popup menu which then activates callback functions passing
no arguments to the callback functions.  The main example has a top
level window with two buttons and a different context menu attached to
each.  To see the popup menus right click on the buttons.  You will
note that the two menus have different colors.

Another example is 'positional' which augments the popup example with an
additional command and an additional callback routine and passes that
callback function the parameter 1 via the variable parameter list
using the only positional parameter.  Finally, the 'keyword' example, does
a similar thing passing the parameter 1 by means of a keyword parameter.
