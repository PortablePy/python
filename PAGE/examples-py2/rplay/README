This example was written as a music server for my Raspberry Pi which
drives my audio system from CD images stored on a Linux box. I use
this program daily. In this example I have a number of different
bindings and utilize a number of text widget tricks that I discovered
by experimentation as well as using multiple threads to run the mp3
player while keeping the GUI fairly responsive.
