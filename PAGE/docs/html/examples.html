<h1>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Examples are the main way that I learned about Tkinter and how to
write code for building GUI’s .  Unfortunately, it is hard to find
examples.  Grayson’s book has been an immense help over the years and
more recently the pyttk-samples distributed by Guilherme Polo have
helped greatly.  The official Tcl documentation is pretty much limited
to man pages which are of minor assistance in getting started with
Tkinter. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Tcl Developers site</a> only recently included
Python code. Much experimentation was required before I was able to
see a paned window on my screen or a scrolled directory.  There are
several interesting examples in the examples subdirectory.</p>
<p>So one may experiment with the examples changing sizes, colors, fonts,
etc. in the GUI modules and they should still work if he does not
regenerate support modules.  At least, one can see some of the
possibilities.  Of course, I have created some of them like menus in
poor taste just to illustrate some of the possibilities. You may
encounter some difficulties which may be due to the absence or miss
match of fonts, etc. between my system and yours.</p>
<p>The easiest way to try the examples is to go to one page/examples
subdirectories and (1) run page against the a ‘.tcl’ file in
that directory and (2) execute the generated GUI module.  Most of the
examples have only one ‘.tcl’. Several examples have two GUI’s and
usually has a ‘main.tcl’; vrex the main GUI is ‘vrex.tcl’ and in ‘two’
the main GUI module definition is ‘w1.tcl’.</p>
<p>If you try saving  the examples by executing PAGE on the Tcl files be
aware that generating and saving support files will replace the
included support files which will become backup versions and the
functioning of the applications will be lost unless the respective
files are restored.</p>
<p>Due to the impending demise of Python 2.7, I am no longer supporting
the examples in the example directory and I have moved the Python 2
examples to the “examples-py2” subdirectory. Python 3 examples are in the
examples subdirectory of the installation directory.</p>
<div class="section" id="directory-browser">
<h2>Directory Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#directory-browser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example contains a scrolled treeview widget that displays ones
UNIX directory tree.  The source for this example is in
examples/directory-tree.py It is a rework of Polo’s example to include
folder icons which open and close.  Polo’s example is Based on
<a class="reference external" href="http://bitwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/ttktreeview.html">bitwalk’s directory browser</a>.
This example, though interesting, was not built using page.</p>

<div class="section" id="vrex">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Vrex<a class="headerlink" href="#vrex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past I have used a number of regular expressions in Python and
used to great advantage <a class="reference external" href="http://laurent.riesterer.free.fr/regexp/">Visual Regexp</a> in composing and testing
those regular expressions and thought that rewriting the program in
Python would be interesting because</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It would illustrate important capabilities of PAGE.</li>
<li>It would be a useful program in its own right. Indeed, I use it all
the time.</li>
<li>The original version was written in Tcl/Tk and so uses the regular
expression processing of Tcl which is bound to be slightly different
from that in Python. So an all Python version using the Python
regular expression processing would be true to Python.</li>
<li>The original program had ZERO documentation. I never could figure
out all of the facilities present. (The most recent version has one
page of documentation.) I wanted a version that I could document.</li>
<li>Vrex uses two Toplevel Widgets; the main GUI shown below and a
separate window for the help facility.</li>
<li>This example illustrates several points about PAGE support: Building
menus, using paned windows, text colorization, synchronization
between two scrolled text windows.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" src="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" />
<p>The main portion of the GUI is a three pane window for entering the
regular expression and sample in the first two and the third pane
presents match results based on the selection of buttons at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the features of PAGE illustrated in this useful program are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scrolled text widgets nested inside of label frames.</li>
<li>Use of two separate GUI’s, one for the main function of the program
and one for a help window.</li>
<li>Colorizing the text within the scrolled text windows.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="vrex-operation">
<h3>Vrex Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#vrex-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Briefly, Vrex works as follows:</p>
<p>One enters the regular expression under test into the top text box,
and the sample which is the subject of the regular expression match
into the middle text box.  One may use the File menu to load files
into the text boxes, one may directly type entries or use the normal
cut and paste facilities of the operating system.  The user can also
save the regular expression and sample using the File menu.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pressing the Go button causes the match to be attempted.  Also,
colorization is applied to both the regular expression and to the
sample. The regular expression is colorized to show the portions of
the regular expression are to extracted individually. And if the
match is successful the corresponding portions of the sample are
displayed in the same colors.</li>
<li>By selecting one of the row of buttons marked match, 1, 2, …, 9,
the portions of the sample corresponding to extracted subpatterns are
displayed in the match window.</li>
<li>You can use the File menu to load to save both the regular expression
and the sample.</li>
<li>The Quit Button terminates the program.</li>
<li>The File menu also has a Quit entry that terminates the program.</li>
<li>The Help menu opens a second GUI containing a ScrolledText widget
which has help information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular expression should be colorized showing the portions to be
extracted in different colors and as well as the matching portion of
the sample.</p>
<p>If you then Select Match, that matching portion of the sample will be
shown in the Match text box. Select 1, and the portion matching the
sub expression will be shown, etc..</p>
<p>You can also load a file into the sample window and thus run the
regular expression against many strings.</p>

<div class="section" id="progress-bar">
<span id="progress"></span><h2>Progress Bar<a class="headerlink" href="#progress-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div>This directory contains two examples which examplyfy progress</div></blockquote>
<p>bars. The first, new, has the progress bar in a separate toplevel
widget, while the other, one, incorporates the progress bar in the
main toplevel. To run the first use the command “python3 new.py”. To
run the other use the command “python3 one .py”</p>
<p>This example shows the usage of the progress bar widget but is included
mainly for illustrating an application with two toplevel windows.  It
shows how the main window is able to interact with variables and
procedures in the imported module which actually displays the progress
bar. It also shows how to hide and restore a widget.</p>
<p>Important features illustrated include the creation and destruction of
the secondary top level window and the fact that the main GUI support
code requires access to Tkinter variables defined and manipulated in
the support module of the other, progress bar, window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex">
<h2>Complex<a class="headerlink" href="#complex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This really isn’t much of an example doing nothing but does showing
nesting of a paned window inside of a paned window and a notebook
widget nested inside of a paned window. By the way, one can enlarge
the top level window and copy and paste the whole paned window to a
new location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menus">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two directories page/examples/menu and page/examples/popup
which demonstrate menus.</p>
<div class="section" id="menu-directory">
<h3>Menu Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The menu directory contains a fairly extreme menu bar example.  Note, I do not
advocate this as a style to be used; it merely suggests some of the
things that can be done.</p>
<p>While this example works as expected within Linux, Windows does not
preserve the specified fonts, and OS X drops the fonts and the colors; see
<a class="reference internal" href="menu.html#menu-example"><span class="std std-ref">images from the three OS,s</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="popup-directory">
<span id="popup"></span><h3>Popup Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#popup-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The popup directory contains a primary example, ‘popup’ which merely
activates a popup menu which then activates callback functions passing
no arguments to the callback functions.  The example have a top
level window with two buttons and a different context menu attached to
each.  To see the popup menus right click on the buttons.  You will
note that the two menus have different colors.</p>
<p>Another example is ‘positional’ which augments the popup example with an
additional command and an additional callback routine and passes that
callback function the parameter 1 via the variable parameter list
using the only positional parameter.  Finally, the ‘keyword’ example, does
a similar thing passing the parameter 1 by means of a keyword parameter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standard-tcl">
<h2>standard.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#standard-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is just a top level window with each of the standard Tk widgets
that I support.  It just shows that I can generate working Python code
for each.   The lowercase ‘s’ emphasizes that it doesn’t do much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="themed-tcl">
<h2>themed.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#themed-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As above for the themed widgets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Paul Krieger donated a canvas example which can be found in the
&lt;page_dir&gt;/examples/canvas directory. I am very thankful since I have
no facility with the canvas widget.</p>
<img alt="_images/p-canvas.png" src="_images/p-canvas.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="clone">
<span id="double"></span><h2>Clone<a class="headerlink" href="#clone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a somewhat kooky example located in examples/clone, where
main.py creates a GUI which presents a button “Make Two” which cause
the creation of two instances of the “called” GUI but with differing
characteristics of location and background colors.  The called GUI is
then able to create incidences of clones with different locations and
background colors.</p>
<p>It is also an example of passing a user parameter to the creation
module which is then passed to the “init” function in the support
module where the color and location are manipulated.</p>
<p>There may be a problem executing this example on Windows if fonts
selected in the tcl are not available on the Windows machine. In that
case the font will default to TkDefaultFont.  Courier New is available
on both my Linux system and my XP box.</p>
<p>This example show two way of defining the textvaribles associated with
the label widgets in the called GUI.  One way is to define
(automatically) as a Tkinter variable in the support module. The second is
to define, again automatically, as a variable in the GUI module by
defining it as “self.&lt;variable&gt;” in the attribute editor.  PAGE
supports both, but I now see no advantage to using the second way, and
I think it is a bit more confusing.</p>

<h2>CPU Info<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu-info" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another small example which displays the output of lscpu on a Linux

<div class="section" id="bind">
<span id="bind-example"></span><h2>Bind<a class="headerlink" href="#bind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This subdirectory contains a bind example where the button
responds to selection with &lt;Button-1&gt; via the command attribute
set in the Attribute Editor and to &lt;Button-2&gt; and &lt;Button-3&gt; via
bind commands created using the Binding Window.</p>
<p>The function named in the command attribute is different from that
in the bind statement because in the latter case an event object is
passed as a parameter to the event handler so the handler must have an
argument to accommodate the event object.</p>

<h3>ScrolledFrame<a class="headerlink" href="#scrolledframe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example, in &lt;page-dir&gt;/examples/custom/canvas, shows how I used a custom
widget called ScrolledFrame which I borrowed from the web. This widget
is used to display 100 buttons on a scrolled canvas.</p>
<p>When the user open PAGE with canvas.tcl, he sees</p>
<img alt="_images/canvas-tcl.png" src="_images/canvas-tcl.png" />
<p>which shows the toplevel window filled with a custom widget. Since the
structure of the widget is unknown to PAGE, it cannot be shown or
manipulated other than sizing or placement.</p>
<p>When the support module custom_support.py is completed with the Python
Tkinter implementation, execution yields</p>
<img alt="_images/custom-widget.png" src="_images/custom-widget.png" />
<p>The main module is canvas.py and the magic is contained in
canvas_support.py, which contains the Python/Tkinter code to implement
the class</p>
<p>In canvas.py the custom widget is referred to in the lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Custom1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">canvas_support</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Custom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">top</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In canvas_support.py the line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Custom</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Frame</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is generated by PAGE causing the Custom widget to implemented as a
Frame widget. In other words, the name Custom refers to the Class
frame. This allows PAGE to display the Custom widget as a Frame widget
with the annotation of “Custom widget” and the execution of the
generated Python code to display the Custom widget as a Frame prior to
including the tkinter implementation in the support module.</p>
<p>The user-added implementation of the ScrolledFrame class at the bottom
of canvas_support.py begins as follows:</p>

<p>This is a second example using the ScrolledFrame widget.</p>
<p>For testing of PAGE, I recoded a photo library program which I wrote
several years ago using PAGE to generate the seven GUI’s required for
the program.  For this example, I have stripped it down to just one
GUI which provides multiple display of just one image.</p>
<p>The demo generates the following window:</p>
<img alt="_images/lib_demo.png" src="_images/lib_demo.png" />
<p>It displays repeated copies of the thumbnail image of a particular
photograph as images on a Button widget. If one selects an image
button with Button-1, a message appears containing the index of the
button. If one selects a button with Button-3, a popup menu appears.
The Zoom cascade menu in both the toplevel window and the popup menu
allows one to change the size of the images displayed.  There is only
one image included in the example and it is displayed 30 times.</p>
<p>When the toplevel window is filled, the program determines, the
maximum number of images that will fit horizontally and puts that
number in each row. If the image is too big to fit, one image per row
is displayed but spills over the edge.</p>
<p>I have included the Busy Cursor code which is located in the shared
module. However, the refresh is so fast, one can hardly see the
different cursor.</p>

<img alt="_images/scrolledchecklistbox.png" src="_images/scrolledchecklistbox.png" />
<p>This annotated example written by Greg Walters is the best example of
the definition and use of a Custom Widget that I have seen. Included
is an extensive write up on usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dual">
<h3>Dual<a class="headerlink" href="#dual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="_images/dual.png" src="_images/dual.png" />
<p>This directory contains an exeample of a GUI with two different custom
widgets, ScrolledCheckedListBox and ScrolledFrame, which were written
externally from PAGE. The variants are “_d” and “_g” which give rise
to class names “Custom_d” and “Custom_g” in the GUI module and which
are renamed ScrolledFrame and ScrolledCheckedListBox in the support
module.</p>
<p>The ScrolledCheckedListBox was written by Greg Walters and is
borrowed from his ScrolledCheckedListBox example picked up and stuffed
into a new “dual” toplevel widget along with a rehash of my lib_demo custom
widget. My original ScrolledFrame proved to have some problem with the
scroll bars, so I modified it along lines which I borrowed from the
ScrolledCheckedListBox widget. The toplevel also has a menubar
borrowed from lib_demo so the entries apply to the ScrolledFrame.</p>
<p>There is a Tsizegrip widget to facilitate resizing the GUI. The event
‘&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;’ is bound to the Tsizegrip so that when Button1 as
released  at the end of a resize, the Custom widget on the right is
refreshed.</p>
<p>You may notice that there is a bunch of special code in
ScrolledCheckedListBox.py  to make that custom widget work with both
Windows and Linux.</p>

<div class="section" id="tksheet-1">
<h3>Tksheet_1<a class="headerlink" href="#tksheet-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example, written by Bill Roberts, employs the tksheet widget as a
custom widget. While tksheet is quite complex, almost 1 MB
in the install directory, very little code was required in the support
module to build this example . The tksheet was created by ragardner
and can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ragardner/tksheet">https://github.com/ragardner/tksheet</a>. Unfortunately, the tksheet
package was released with incomplete documentation.</p>

<p>This is another example using Tksheet_2.  This one

<p>The tksheet_2 subdirectory also contains an article discussing this
example that Greg has written for FullCircle magazine to which Greg
contributes to on a monthly basis.  The article references an earlier
article for FullCircle magazine issue 155 of a more introductory
nature. That article is included in the docs/tutorial subdirectory of
the installation directory.</p>

<div class="section" id="calendar2">
<span id="cal2"></span><h3>Calendar2<a class="headerlink" href="#calendar2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example uses the Calendar widget from the ttkwidgets package.</p>
<img alt="_images/cal2.png" src="_images/cal2.png" />
<p>I used the following code in the support module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">ttkwidgets</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Calendar</span>

<div class="section" id="two">
<h2>Two<a class="headerlink" href="#two" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is an example of a project which contains two simple windows w1
and w2.  It issustrates how the support module for window 1 creates
window 2 and passing it a parameter which is used to set a label. It
also has another example of the TProgressbar widget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="three">
<h2>Three<a class="headerlink" href="#three" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example has three GUI’s where The main GUI invokes a second which
invokes the third which sports popup menus bound to the buttons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rplay">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Rplay<a class="headerlink" href="#rplay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/rplay.png" src="_images/rplay.png" />
<p>This example was written as a music server for my Raspberry Pi which
drives my audio system from CD images stored on a Linux box. I use this
program daily.  In this example I have a number of different bindings
and utilize a number of text widget tricks that I discovered by
experimentation as well as using multiple threads to run the mp3
player while keeping the GUI fairly responsive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hide">
<h2>Hide<a class="headerlink" href="#hide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An example shows how to hide a widget and later retrieve it. This is
an example of dynamic widgets.  See <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#dynamic-widgets"><span class="std std-ref">Dynamic Widgets</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="labelframe">
<h2>Labelframe<a class="headerlink" href="#labelframe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Greg Walters contributed this example to help debug the recent fixes

<div class="section" id="scrolledwindow">
<span id="sfimage"></span><h2>Scrolledwindow<a class="headerlink" href="#scrolledwindow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These examples can be found in the examples-3/scrolledwindow subdirectory.</p>
<p>This exemplifies the creation of a Scrolledwindow and populates it with
a column of Button widgets.</p>
<p>This was the first example that I constructed using the Scrolledwindow
widget. The files are f.tcl, f.py, and f_support.py.</p>
<img alt="_images/scrolledwindow.png" src="_images/scrolledwindow.png" />
<p>This example is a rewrite of the lib_demo example described above. The
files are new.tcl, new.py, and new_support.py.</p>

<div class="section" id="tip">
<h2>Tip<a class="headerlink" href="#tip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/tooltip.png" src="_images/tooltip.png" />
<p>This example has three button widgets one of which, the Dest button
has a tool tip.</p>
<p>When the Change button is selected, The tooltip message is changed and
a tooltip is added to the Quit button.</p>
<p>The addition of the tooltip to the quit button requires access to the
definition of the Tooltip class.  The code definition of the ToolTip
class was added to the GUI module because I had specified a tooltip
for the Change button. If Iad not set up a tooltip in the GUI module I
would have had to add that code manually to the support module.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="full-screen">
<h2>Full Screen<a class="headerlink" href="#full-screen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/fullscreen.png" src="_images/fullscreen.png" />
<p>This example has a simple GUI. When the generated Python is executed
the toplevel window expands to fill the entire screen. F11 and Escape
keys control whether the GUI occupies the full screen or not as does
the Screen submenu.</p>
<p>Because the GUI is in Relative mode, the size of the text widget and
the widget placement also change correspondingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h2>Scrolledlistbox<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
