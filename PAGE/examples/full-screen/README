This example has a simple GUI. When the generated Python is executed
the toplevel window expands to fill the entire screen. F11 and Escape
keys control whether the GUI occupies the full screen or not as does
the Screen submenu.

Because the GUI is in Relative mode, the size of the text widget and
the widget placement also change correspondingly.
