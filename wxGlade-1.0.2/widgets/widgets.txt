# List of widget modules
#
# List all available widget modules - each on a own line.
#
# The modules can optionally be grouped by preceding section headers.
# A section header is the name of the section enclosed in square brackets.
# It may be followed by :K for hotkey
#
# Empty lines will be ignored. Lines beginning with hash sign ('#') are
# ignored too and may be used to provide comments.
#
# Comments can also entered after modules or sections. Use the hash sign
# ('#') preceded by a whitespace character for such cases.
