This directory contains the files from the tutorial:


These files show different stages and versions of the design:

 Calculator-01.wxg
 Calculator-02.wxg
 Calculator-03.wxg
 Calculator-04-Notebook.wxg
 Calculator-05-Spacers.wxg
 Calculator-06-GridSizer.wxg



The last files show how to handle events and implement the required business logic.

See section "Create and Use Source Code" of the manual.
 ( wxglade/wxglade_dev_08/docs/html/source_code.html )


Version 1: Edit in place / “Keep user code”
This one is OK for small projects and prototypes.

 Calculator-07-Keep.wxg
 Calculator.py: the code generated by wxGlade, with additional user code




Version 2: Import and override
This approach is much better for larger projects.

 Calculator_Main.py: the main file with user code/business logic; run this one
 Calculator_GUI.py: the GUI code generated by wxGlade, no user code inside
 Calculator-07-Import.wxg: the wxGlade design file
