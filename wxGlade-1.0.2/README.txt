wxGlade: A GUI builder for wxPython/wxWidgets
=============================================

Version: 1.0.2

THIS PROGRAM COMES WITH NO WARRANTY


Introduction
------------

wxGlade is a GUI builder for wxWidgets/wxPython.
It can create Python, C++, Perl, Lisp and XRC output.


Requirements
------------

 - Python (http://www.python.org) 2.7, 3.4 or later
 - wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org) >= 2.8
   (wxPython Phoenix, i.e. release >=4.0.0, is supported)

If you have a choice, you should prefer wxPython Phoenix running on Python 3.x.
See https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/ for download and installation instructions.
On Windows and macOS it can be installed with ``python -mpip install wxPython``.


Installation
------------

Download the latest released version as zip archive from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade/

Unpack the archive to a known location and maybe add it to the path.

If you are familiar with git, you may instead just clone the repository from
https://github.com/wxGlade/wxGlade.git
The master branch should be stable enough for your work and I appreciate bug reports.


Running wxGlade
---------------

To start the program, change directory to the installation directory you unzipped to and
enter 'python3 wxglade.py' or 'python wxglade.py' in your shell or use whatever is
required to start a python application on your platform.

You may want to add a desktop shortcut to run the 'wxGlade.py' file (or the 'wxGlade.pyw' file).

If you want to build a GUI for wxPython Classic or Phoenix:
Start wxGlade in your target version - if it runs under Phoenix, it will
create Phoenix code. The .wxg file format is not affected by this. So you may
use a single .wxg file to generate code for both Classic and Phoenix.
The generated code should always run under both Python 2.7 and Python 3.


Documentation and Tutorial
--------------------------

The documentation is at docs\html\index.html and includes a tutorial.
You can view it from the help menu as well.

The target audience includes people who have not yet been using wxPython
or wxWidgets before.


A snapshot of the documentation including tutorial can be found here:

This one is not always up to date, though.
